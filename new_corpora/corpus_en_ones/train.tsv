1	stopped for months as it caused terrible side effect. had to start back up or lose my job r soooo fun
1	seroquel and alcohol don't mix&gt;&gt; hard to keep my head up haha
1	i have been on enbrel, remicade, and simponi. enbrel didn't work well enough for me.
1	enbrel is a joke. it should never be taken. the side effects are terrible. there's plenty of natural herbs that heal with no side effect ...
1	is not doing me any favors
1	welll..decided to get off paxil. withdrawals are killlerrr, like loss of circulation randomly in areas.
1	that'll be the quetiapine making you drowsy. it's a common side effect xx
1	whilst palpitating thanks to ventolin hooo im so high
1	ugh i hate metformin im sick
1	so that would elain the bronchitis.... it may not be an allergy, but the effects of using advair over a long period of time
1	can't even take a seroquel cause i gotta wake up smfh
1	probably having pregabalin withdrawal symptoms right now... i guess it wasn't a good idea to avoid taking them yesterday then -_-
1	that suuuuucks. ambien made me a zombie. lunesta was lovely for the short time i took it. now using xanax as needed.
1	i have a lozenge i cant feel my throat
1	amitriptyline is great at night, but it knocked me out too much. diclofenac is a bit stronger than naproxen
1	are restlessness and insomnia common side-effects of / ?
1	omg seroquel. that made me crazy town. i hope it's a low dose. so it's almost midnight. last gulp now, and sober tomorrow.
1	i hated being on paxil for that reason. way to make you *more* depressed. x.x
1	me too, remicade for a year, humira, and had an allergic reaction to cimzia, almost killed me in november.
1	i'd rather be on the effer that made me happy though i had severe back pain from it.. than sad and crying for no reason on lexapro....
1	rt : suicidal thoughts, lack of feeling for others &amp; oneself are common side effect of atypical antipsychotics like seroquel h…
1	another note to my future self: diclofenac works wonders. be careful not to burn your arm (you won't feel anything anymore) like i just did.
1	anxiety has been so high. but yeah, if your dosage is high its hard to come off. i had to detox from pristiq (its cousin drug)
1	remicade was my last treatment before humira and i really loved it. then i started having a reaction from it multiple times
1	that nuvaring got me feelin like sonic sometimes
1	right now i can't tell if i'm wide awake or exhausted. day of cutting viibryd in half is almost complete.
1	i couldn't take lamictal week into it i got the rash.a rush trip to the er.6 months till rash was gone.
1	achilles tendon rupture is a side effect of fluoroquinolones stay away from cipro!!!!
1	seroquel left me with sleep paralysis. abilify left me with occasional muscle spasms. i've been off of both for nearly a decade.
1	promethazine with codein, a tessalon pearl &amp; a trazodone. i'm not coughing anymore but i'm even more exhausted.
1	oh, and i forgot that with lamotrigine come awful night terrors. i woke up no fewer than five times screaming and sweaty.
1	i'm on gabapentin now, it's not really working for me..but everyone is different. gabapentin makes me feel drunk
1	but has the after-sting, which is worse! yuck. reminds me, i need to go take my shot
1	i have a life appointment tomorrow, and i'm going to cry to her about lamictal. because it makes everything worse. i hate medication.
1	adderall puts me in a good mood, vyvanse makes me an asshole.
1	crestor causes diabetes....google it.....
1	crohnie here. but i used to be on humira and got switched to infliximab after humira attacked my bones ?
1	me : feeling fine, watching tv ... swiffer commercial : lol lets make the bitch cry at this... a fucking swiffer commercial.
1	i'm so irritable when my vyvanse wears off
1	apparently lunesta and stairs are not a good pair!
1	took like half a bottle of lunesta and i'm still awake
1	the only things i know i'm allergic to are sulfa drugs and ciprofloxacin.
1	had my doctor attempted to treat with bactrim prior to cipro, i wouldn't be crippled today.
1	this nuvaring gives me the worst cramps all month long
1	put half a tube of diclofenac on my back and i'm still in agony
1	""": i'm feeling pretty good for only having one hour of sleep"" adderall will do that to ya."
1	steady dose of meds, anti-inflams, pain killer and lots of water. uloric is by far best but kills ur gut.
1	lunesta is hours of miserable sleep and nothing like the fascinating well funded ad campaign.
1	i was on venlafaxine after the citalopram but it messed up my sleep
1	i stopped one pill and everything is cool except i still am shaky and i'm taking lunesta but i keep sleeping
1	albuterol sulfate+symbicort=missey is tweaked
1	i just got diagnosed a few weeks ago with bpd...they put me on seroquel and kept me on zoloft with it. it makes me eat a lot.
1	trazodone hangover and dry eyes
1	brilinta eerienced headwinds after u
1	i love the gorgeous burgundy color and powdery mouthfeel of the advair
1	doesn't work. citilopram then fluoxetine before, bothe did nothing for my mood but made me vomit so much i lost stone in mo.
1	i had allergic reaction from enbrel.
1	means antara you're gonna be sleeping when the sun comes up or you're not gonna sleep at all.can't sleep.
1	venlafaxine hangover finally starting to shift after huge mugs of hot water with giant pieces of lemon...
1	. synthroid causing freq afib. wht is my alternative?
1	two doses of percocet along with mg of gabapentin are in my system right now. i was told i'm really loopy atm. hahaha goodnight!
1	you guys are going to have to hear about my withdrawal from paxil. unfollow while you have the chance!!! day one....
1	i think i might be allergic to effer. i just woke up feeling sick, meh.
1	helped my but then issues ensued &amp; now i can't take anything &amp; have major lung issues
1	dear seizure buddies, never ever take vimpat. side effects &amp; withdrawals are quite fucking hideous. love, meh
1	rp mcmurphy was right about the trazodone being my new favorite bed-buddy. rip, melatonin dreams. you were getting too weird - even for me.
1	they got salvia, i think it mixed with my neurontin (prescribed to me for rls) and then it just set off a panic attack.
1	annnnnnnnnnnd here goes the last week of viibryd withdrawal. super neat.
1	metformin has the potential to cause nausea, loose stools etc. as a potential side effect
1	day seven off the baclofen and i've got cold sweats and constant insomnia... i'm running on fumes at this point.
1	shitty ass ventolin not even helping
1	venlafaxine gave me horrendous nightmares, &amp; coming of it was horrific.!
1	holy shit the mg saphris tablet tastes infinitely worse than the mg my mouth is on fire, gross pukey fire
1	i just choked on my ciclesonide and had an asthma attack
1	yeah know what u mean. i upped my lyrica again yesterday. pain bit better but bit wobbly on my feet when i got up!!
1	a shug ? is that a self hug? wish i could do that - damm thalidomide
1	told va last year, crestor worked for me, did not cause muscle pain; on my rd cholesterol med trial, all cause muscle pain.
1	seroquel has arrived. question now is when do i want to be zombified?
1	i really feel like this fluoxetine is messing with my perspective time and people.
1	geodon withdrawl is hell.
1	rt : what i lack in money and personality, i make up for in paxil induced impotency
1	etanercept (enbrel) which can be got in pens, but the preservative stings, so he mixes his own&gt;
1	when i'm trying to eat a decent meal on adderall i feel the struggle of the kid in matilda who was forced to finish the chocolate cake
1	joe is on pristiq and he gets weird brain zap / twitch things too.
1	magically my appetite has gone back to normal since going off seroquel! well, well, well - i was right, the doctor was wrong.
1	nicotine withdrawal is hitting me so fuckin hard right now
1	you guys i was sucking on this lozenge thats supposed to numb sore throats and now i cant feel my mouth
1	i feel like i have a hangover ...that cymbalta was a bad idea
1	"took , maybe minutes to go from ""why isn't the seroquel working"" to ""what is a bed, i will just use my keyboard"""
1	mine was sleep paralysis. i hope you're not on viibryd
1	take tamiflu and drink water like crazy. i didn't and now i'm super dehydrated
1	does anyone happen to know if lamictal causes you to feel hot?

1	didnt take my vyvanse and remembered what food is
1	too scared to go back to sleep horrid imposing dream
1	i started prozac a few hours ago and the only side effect i've had was some dizziness. much better than viibryd which had me puking.
1	the levaquin is very strong. not too many side effects for dad. it just takes away all his strength.
1	this gotta nigga feelin like a slow turtle.
1	been taking low dosage of paroxetine for the last two years and only recently found out that a common side affect is pinsandneedles.
1	the aythromicyn didn't work so i'm back on cipro which is what caused my septic c diff in sept.
1	i tried baclofen, another common muscle relaxer, and had too many side-effects from it, including worsening pain.
1	i wonder if olanzapine causes restless legs &lt;_&lt;
1	fluoxetine. killed my libido stone dead.
1	rt : it appears that my twitter addiction may have just been a side effect of my nicotine lozenge addiction.
1	fuck molly . vyvanse is what gets ya sweatin
1	not to worry - just a bit of temporary fuzziness. i've been on humira since &amp; love it.
1	you'll have to let me know how remicade works for you! it's next on my list of things to take, since enbrel isn't working.
1	i fell asleep at like :00. now i'm wide awake. gabapentin is weird like that. knocks me on my ass.
1	damn, i'm so proud of you!! i'm still limping from the levaquin cure for my pneumonia that dissolved left knee cartilage...
1	ant take anti seizure meds or anti depressants and cymbalta and savella made me very sick
1	oh what a shitty day. forgot to take my geodon this morning and have had withdraws and anxiety all day. i would like to quit that shit.

1	feeling a little dizzy from the quetiapine i just popped!
1	at my old weight my bmi was . i hate seroquel and prozac and my new pill, i don't eat but still gain weight.
1	taking trazodone and literally passing out on the bathroom floor yeah that shit happens
1	i tried that going cold turkey on venlafaxine and depakote is not a good idea i dreamt colours and lost my fucking mind aghh!
1	fun fact: lunesta will make stuff taste gross to you when you take it. it's terrible.
1	i developed lupus w/remicade, was bedbound on humira and severe allergic reaction to cimzia
1	alendronate is an important cause of pill esophagitis, in osteoporosis give raloxifene instead.
1	tamiflu killed my best friend i wouldnt want anyone to use that shit
1	too tired to function right now, thanks humira.
1	cipro destroyed my entire body, from head to toe. bedridden since . be very careful.
1	the effer dreams have taken a terrifying turn. ugh.
1	hi twitter. my brain's mushier than a million blancmanges. pregabalin at max dose does that. i miss trying(!) to be amusing &amp; spamming you &gt;
1	my vyvanse is seriously about to drive me crazy
1	partial complex on lamotrigine lacosamide zonisamide poor memory, trip over my tongue. anyone the same?
1	vyvanse fucks me up man, no way in hell i can do that one. never taken focalin tho
1	count kum hai, can't avoid it being a nicotine addict. :/
1	do you think ms or tysabri effects teeth. the enamel or you get more toothaches ?
1	crippled since oct of '09 thanks to just cipro pills here...run for your life! tendon rupture is only the tip of the iceberg.
1	was on seroquel for years in my teens &amp; stopped taking it. a 'quack' doc put me back on it &amp; i gained in months.
1	have any of you developed hives after tysabri infusions ?
1	coming off effer was the worst ever. even my doctor was terrified of me doing it but the side effects left me no choice.
1	latuda is really taking a toll on me, i've never been this tense. maybe it has to do with the healing meditation last night.
1	celexa made me fat and lazy. viibryd made it worse. i feel like there's nothing out there that will work for me.
1	banana? hot milk? and randomly lettuce! all contain sleepy bye chems. all i have is trazodone which means dopey all day tomo
1	my ex was on geodon and she had a seizure in the latrine at ait. i would just fall asleep at metro stops, restaurants
1	rt : enbrel also available as prefilled syringe, much gentler. pen leaves bruises!
1	my metformin is giving me such bad back pain i cry
1	lexapro gave me the worst mixed episodes. i have some instability with pristiq but i can manage it ok.
1	how is it that vyvanse gives me dry mouth, but i still produce this much saliva in my sleep?
1	going to ask the gp for sleeping tablets. tried temazepam before which at least gave me a few nights sleep before it stopped working.
1	let's talk about how i forgot what adderall felt like and now i'm on it again and i'm going nuts.
1	fuck adderall i'm tryina sleep and it's am umm??? rude
1	the medicine januvia is the worst blood sugar medicine ever! the side effects are ridiculous!
1	oh well this might be why the side effects from cold turkey quitting pristiq were so horrible. it is concentrated effer.
1	that's the hardest part: difficult to willingly self-inflict pain.
1	sleeping my life away on . fine by me.
1	ok well try your best. i'm on saphris but i can only take mg at most or get an anxiety attack.
1	rt : my philly dr prescribed me trazodone,1pill made me so fkn sick, couldnt move day.xtreme migraine, puke, shakes. any1else …
1	smh. lmao paxil was my first, i just stopped effer (the headaches were a nightmare)
1	i had a year on prozac which ruined my creativity too - my memory now is awful - pregabalin does it but it's worth it!!!
1	wow my meds really strong but they keep the pain away neurontin mg it's just getting used to them being weaned on them side effects rough
1	congrats on the enbrel and yeah especially the first couple of times is quite oh squicky why am i doing this.
1	i'm too high on oxycodone for my tooth ache to check x:
1	hate prednisone yet need it. humira tried to kill me. so did remicade. so..
1	no, digoxin is the right answer. because ranolazine cause hypotension
1	i think i've had more oxycodone in the past days than your average codeine addict... yet it still doesn't numb the pain.
1	well! that was icky. i think lamictal and lexapro do not get along when taken within hours of each other.
1	“: i'm never tired at night ” adderall
1	0 day rivaroxaban diary. woken up by pain in neck, hips and legs.
1	hours sleep and still i feel tired and dizzy
1	enbrel shots hurt.
1	i'm desperate for better diabetes education for my dr after nearly dying after misdiagnosed metformin induced lactic acidosis
1	currently :14 am.... still can't sleep. adderall still not fading. still have my am final........
1	well hello am. thanks lunesta for not doing your one job
1	levofloxacin seems to be our worst offender for inr elevation
1	"prozac is the bartering stage. tell them it's not working. do not say ""friends say duloxetine is like being on e hours a day""."
1	please tell me that wasn't quetiapine! that stuff is sooo sedating...
1	when the depression is coming out caused by this damn levofloxacin
1	on pregabalin (was on oxycontin/norm) gone from size to size ! trying to lose weight by calorie watching.. so difficult.
1	when i was taking a full dose of , i didn't even realize that sleeping hours a night, then falling asleep every day, wasn't normal.
1	struggling with effer withdrawal. worse than any symptoms i was taking the drug for.stay away from this!!!
1	sedated before my medication fucking strange. then feel nothing after a dose of subone even stranger. non acceptable.
1	this lozenge has made my throat so numb!
1	lamotrigine causing steven johnson syndrome
1	i take asacol every morning. doesn't help toilet much but stops stabbing pains. loperamide helps too.
1	also lunesta generally puts me to sleep but gives me a hangover the next morning, &amp; i don't feel more energetic than w/o sleep.
1	woo it's so awesome when my adderall makes me have a rapid heart rate when i run so i look like i'm about to have a heart attack
1	i got the joint pain from remicade, humira made it worse &amp; gave me neuropathy in my feet &amp; my hair falling out like crazy
1	yes def eat or the cipro will tear u up and feel better
1	pt of mine died from cipro rt : if only more doctors thought like you! i lost my entire life to cipro pills
1	gotta find an alternative to vyvanse, asap. i'd rather be sleepy &amp; happy, than alert &amp; depressed!
1	hey gurrrl, it might just be the januvia talking but i have severe abdominal pain that may be severe pancreatitis and lead to death.
1	off, and i did nuvaring and i had no period for months and i was so happy! but then i spotted for months straight and i was
1	today i'm an emotional mess. that's what happens when i think i could wean myself off of cymbalta.
1	so damn sleepy. this seroquel is fucking me up so bad.
1	i'm not allowed to take seroquel &amp; neurontin &amp; then go cook food cause i nod out like i'm on dope &amp; make a fuckin mess whoops hahaha
1	quite a lot left over from back problems. gabapentin are pretty trippy too dont really need em anymore. good for emergencies
1	i was on methotrexate but it wasn't working for me and causing tons of fatigue. i'll be on straight enbrel to start.
1	well no. but it's just that i dropped my quetiapine last night. i slept horribly! but i feel v unfoggy...
1	how anyone can say there is no withdrawal from prozac withdrawal is beyond me. their answer is to go back on it and up the dose.
1	gabapentin &amp; tramadol don't work for shit. make me sick. i hate them but can't get others
1	coming up this week: seroquel is notorious for two things - making you sleep until next tuesday, and leaving you a hangover. lovely.
1	i've taken the bp daily if not twice a day like i should, it's juz i didn't think the effer would spike it so. i'm usually
1	scared of my . keep feeling like i'm having a heart attack or panic attack. anyone else have these problems?
1	ventolin injections. make the body move and tremble like jelly. weird and funny.
1	gave in wholeheartedly today to my olanzapine munchies. had already had an ice cream and milkshake before this :-0
1	my philly dr prescribed me trazodone,1pill made me so fkn sick, couldnt move day.xtreme migraine, puke, shakes. any1else get that react?

1	erm my pdoc wants me to go back on quetiapine. pointed out it had caused a heart arrhythmia last time. going back to gp to look at my ecg
1	well i’m taking it with a mood stabilizer (lamictal). i can’t take anti-depressants by themselves-triggers my rapid cycling
1	exhausted...can't fall asleep. don't wanna take a trazadone and wake up hungover.
1	rt : if this fuckin emt looks at me one more time hes gonna feel the wrath of my vyvanse rage
1	you know starting with geodon, the meds messed up my attitude. how odd. it's not just about spirituality. i became a bit mean. that got
1	ugh i'm trying to figure out how i got infectious colitis... the flagyl and levaquin have knocked me on my butt
1	dang metformin kinda helped with weight at first but now it's not much, periods are just hell though.
1	sildenafil side-effect, lowering of kelvin midpoint in eyesight. tungsten lamp appears white and sky twice as blue.
1	cymbalta. x the dosage i was once on...everything is psychedelic and yuck. still grateful for meds!
1	i took pills of geodon i was rushed to the hospital they had to stick a tube up my nose ugh never again i feel so bad today withdrawals.
1	today is a rubbish health day and it's all been caused by one little imodium tablet. i can never win the with my organs.
1	i might go back on the venlafaxine &amp; give it another chance but it was wrecking my sleep x
1	nawh bactrim. cipro made me sick once.
1	prescription drug abuse looks like adderall and sometimes but rarely vicodin where i live
1	the amount of adderall shits that will be taken in the lib this week is disturbing
1	gabapentin gives one hell of a buzz. they finally have some good shit for that. lexapro.
1	oh, that's all. i remember when they took me off geodon and i slept for three days.
1	started taking metformin and been throwing up constantly
1	i'm not sure if seroquel is helping us or making things even worse.. anyone else knows if it can make dissociation worse?
1	am in the morning still awake valium didn't work subone still not working unproductive lame and boring and somebody gas a free buzz super
1	nicotine withdrawals
1	yes! same thought. the mg geodon one is quite disturbing, he literally stabbed the paper.
1	fucking vyvanse, giving me cotton mouth. ugh.
1	oh yep! the only trouble with seroquel for me is i don't want to get up in the morning. i've always been an early riser.
1	just popped nonstimulant adderall pills (not the good stuff) and now my mind is like soaring and i think im going crazy
1	but first! try these lovely pharmies! &lt;— can’t cum feel numb hate life more and everyone else ? _o
1	she and i are both colon free now, so no humira or remicade! they failed miserably at helping us.
1	i'm on enbrel right now... not starting mtx til november. i know that 'hungover' feeling though hope it gets better for u!
1	the fda has killed more americans than al-qaeda, ,000 due to it's vioxx scam alone, plus ,000 heart attacks..!
1	i had a very bad reaction to victoza and the fever it caused sent my glucose up to &amp; i had to go back to insulin to sort.
1	lunesta is a joke. why am i awake right now?!
1	ooooo geeez that's not good. did they fix it? dysmotility. bloating, gas, etc etc. intense abdominal pain. on vsl &amp; miralax but

1	effer dreams d:

1	day of completed. 2 miles of walking. can't run even if i could because of cipro. also day of mostly raw was good.
1	i took a vyvanse and drank a oz redbull this morning. my heart was hurting a lil bit haha
1	concussion micro-update: decreasing the viibryd seems to have lessened the headaches but made forgetfulness and food aversions worse.
1	oh! i am on enbrel but i was on methotrexate prior to that, it didn't agree with me and wasn't effective for me so
1	yeah, you'll suffer no matter what. i would say subone withdrawal is worse than methadone, but both are pretty horrible.
1	already has a higher risk of blood clots than other hormonal smoking &amp; being overweight add more risks.
1	i was one of them-given levaquin for sinus infec. -reaction-drs. do not take serious enough and now disabled for yrs. please
1	metformin only has gi upset issues mostly, other than that its quite safe, but i take it because i need it
1	ty, its nasty. they bleed for ages bcoz i'm on rivaroxaban which is like mega warfarin so don't clot easy. then they ooze 'stuff'!!
1	another light nights sleep brought to me courtesy of dammit.
1	cough medicine with codeine + a breathing treatment + pro air + symbicort + steroids = no sleep. &amp; i still can't fucking breathe.
1	when ur miralax didnt work and ur still backed up

1	taking entyvio now for crohn's since remicade stopped working and humira didn't work...
1	this higher dose of is making me extremely tired and anxious. is this normal?
1	don't take viibryd i used to and it makes you really out of it :x
1	popped a vyvanse i'm tweaking. whoop
1	whoah so dizzing. damn tamazapam - shld probably wap back to quetiapine if this keeps up! but it makes me feel so ick!
1	yeah, generic venlafaxine has about four different slow release formulations, i got withdrawals from some.
1	i used my kid's nebulizer with albuterol once. ho-lee crap. i was vibrating for like an hour.
1	just had my enbrel injection for this week.. can just tell straightaway when it's hit a bad area in the stomach ouch
1	...these horrors are on info sheet in box!! lyrica elains weight gain &amp; cym elains so much more. why don't they tell us? dammit
1	i've been having them today too, three days without effer. i completely understand what you mean. every hit, lightheaded..
1	"what i take is serious. i never was informed ahead of time. i could get ""metabolic"" syndrome from seroquel."
1	"the website for lyrica says ""elimination half-life of about hours"" the last time i took was at about pm last night leh! why still dizzy!!"
1	hopefully i would love to chat or talk by skype with you and your team. i am on med saphris. i lost pounds months ago.
1	i’m sort of nauseous. don’t know if it’s a side effect of the viibryd or i need to eat more or what. unpleasant.
1	it's called seroquel prolong (quetiapine). apart from the weight gain, i am actually quite happy with it.
1	i swear thia cymbalta is causing me to have horrible nightmares!
1	no wonder they tell you to take levaquin with plenty of water.....don't mind me, just riding out the waves of intense nausea here
1	rivaroxaban diary day muscle &amp; back pains were due to being on rvxbn for days, on it + losartan for days, + losartan only for days
1	i was on tysabri for months. i'm in the process of going to tecfedera. it is similar, i needed to get off because of veins
1	on my way to derriford hospital. having an allergic reaction to new drug. asenapine sucks.
1	doctors, why am i more wheezy since starting ventolin and flovent ? i want to be able to breathe again.
1	the pathway of cipro is definitely murdering my mind right now
1	desvenlafaxine makes you lose weight though because you can't eat anything on it, it's killer. but it's been keeping me saner.
1	fuck here comes the nicotine cravings damn you hookah
1	bigged you up to the wife last night, whilst tipsy on diclofenac
1	victoza makes me have no appetite at all!!
1	i need to progress onto oxazepam.apparently it's more sedating. seroquel is sedating, but you can hardly open or close your mouth.
1	i'm sorry to hear that. i had a side effect from humira that negated all tnf blockers so no enbrel for me either.
1	i'm taking varenicline &amp; it's making me feel so sick..i've tried anti sickness tablets but they don't work! any advice?!
1	sorry to barge in but remicade stopped working for me after months, now i'm on humira smh. i hope this works.
1	so glad i'm off , so sad it ruined my teeth. please be carefull w/ taking and read about it st!

1	"i watched that movie ""side effects"" while coming off paxil and relapsed"

1	"""vyvanse was like aderall and crack i got ten minutes of sleep pearl"""
1	what meds are you on? gabapentin /pregablin =horrible weight gain. opiates can cause very bad nausea /stomach pains /vomiting...
1	i took a depakote, zyprexa, tramadol, flexeril, naproxen, a gram, blunts..... and almost died.. i turned green
1	rt : finding out i'm allergic to fluoxetine was a bit of a shock tho. mind, only someone from yorkshire could be actually allergic …
1	yeah, ambien is also addictive, so short term is the goal. ask about seroquel? tell the doc about all the health stuffs though
1	rt : when are you going to do true life: i am addicted to vyvanse?

1	i realized it the viibryd but i swear i never been but it's in the morning . i can't sleep , so it's git to be building up
1	ventolin was pretty harsh, i remember that racing heart feeling.
1	olanzapine together. olanzapine is causing me to gain weight because i binge eat on it, normally in the evening. also sick of the joint pain
1	no pain is worse than humira. not even arthritis. lmfao.
1	i'm trying to go off it. i'm on lamictal now and it works but i'm still addicted to geodon
1	rivaroxaban is great, until your patient gets a wound and bleeds solidly for hours from it!
1	then the viibryd it will be the hardest. makes you very ill. hospital ill.
1	im like sweating. i think the adderall i working.
1	i'd like to thank metformin for keeping me on the couch for a week straight. drugs sure are awesome!
1	tysabri infusion today at hospital. extra shattered this time. can't keep my eyes open.
1	kind of moot now, imo, bc nobody's giving me sulfa drugs again, or taking me off celebrex or lamictal unless i get the rash back
1	do not ever get on cymbalta. getting off of it is hell!
1	two days without my seroquel… i feel like death, seriously
1	i'm taking tamiflu and feel like i'm gonna throw up all the time
1	3 rivaroxaban diary day . some neck pain and legs still weak, but feeling much better. very warm night.
1	my mom used rivaroxaban and it gave her a terrible time with weakness and muscle pain.
1	my tremors are horrible. fuck seroquel.
1	the only medication (of which i am aware...and i know almost all of them) that has a regular headache side-effect is lamictal.
1	slept hours last night on seroquel o.o
1	"my mri scan shows when it happens but it could be a ""reaction"" to being on infliximab this time, as i did not react on the humira"
1	i'm already taking enbrel but it's annoying and a bitch. if i don't take anything i won't be able to walk..so it's not an option
1	2 day rivaroxaban diary. still residual aches and pains; only had paracetamol today.
1	huh? i just get chronic bronchitis due to bad asthma and allergies and non advair compliance
1	with effer if i miss one day i am dizzy and wrecked
1	"i think taking advair literally made me shrink an inch because i've been '9"" for years and the last year i was measured as '8"" twice wtf"
1	stop taking xarelto immediately if you suddenly start hemorrhaging out of your nostrils. glad i read the fine print
1	i feel your pain. and i tried the ambien and lunesta route but that stuff made me feel stupid.
1	fluoxetine is a hell of a drug if you're into being awake all night and feeling ill.
1	enbrel fucking hurts
1	it's very tough. i understand, &amp; you have my full sympathy. how did you find cymbalta withdrawals?
1	why i came off it. gp told me its not dangerous but it is damn unpleasant. at least i know it's the quetiapine that's causing it
1	tysabri helped with my flares but killed my immune system. haven't had side effects from aubagio ++++
1	i reckon i have drug-induced oedema causing musculo-skeletal pain. likely drug combination: rivaroxaban, losartan, and simvastatin.
1	officially addicted to nicotine
1	but diclofenac also has more gastro issues - i had to give up, but it was ace with tramadol.
1	i used to take trazodone. made me sleep for dayyssss
1	take adderall so you dont feel like shit from adderall wearing off then take adderall when that adderall wears off then take adderall whe...
1	i took it so long that i have a tolerance. requested lunesta last time and it works even less than ambien.
1	hello hughniverse! i've been away because i spent two weeks in the hospital. the enbrel i was taking helped my ra, but trashed my immune
1	good. i'm afraid to use my advair since the thrush infection
1	cipro is awful makes me sick as a dog too
1	why do i always get the seroquel munchies!?
1	oops i did'nt eat before taking the gabapentin now i'm floating on the breeze...lol...won't do that again...phhwahhh.
1	i had a weird rash w/ enbrel. but it was all over my abdomen &amp; chest. rash in elbow cld b psoriasis? can u take a pic?
1	the day after humira used to be a great one, full of energy, low pain. after a month, it is now a fatigue filled achy day.
1	conclusion: my psychiatrist is not very attentive and i should be on seroquel, not benzos and the maniatriggering lamitol.
1	migh need to change it due to hallucinations.my mom took restoril
1	since i stopped synthroid, metformin and victoza i have much less aches and pains. wondering if i even have
1	reading about all the risk and side effects from the nuvaring kinda makes me nervous.. as if i don't worry enough without searching google..
1	darvocet never worked for me. currently prescribed hydrocodone, robaxin and an anti-nauseal.
1	pristiq somehow doesn't make me less horny, but when i gain weight it's only in gut so i can't do that
1	pristiq and i don't mind them sometimes but sometimes they're really emotional and i can't sleep then
1	quetiapine - i slept!! weirdo dreams and very drowsy this morning but i slept!!!
1	humira worked for me much better than remicaid. i felt constantly beat up on r. humira was much easier to administer, too.
1	not that anyone noticed, but my only lasted a few days. why? because i got another scrip. i need it while i'm on levaquin.
1	people taking - does this need to sleep /7 go eventually? cos this is not sustainable beyond the short term.
1	i don't want to take my humira at all the pain is always unbearable and i don't wanna
1	celecoxib + naproxen + paracetamol and still the pain is there &gt;_&lt; wooooo! sciaticaaaaaa!
1	after going into anaphilaxis w/remicade i am nervous to start humira after being off it for a year, anyone know about this
1	i knew one day enbrel would b the death of me
1	don't quit viibryd cold turkey. it's a disaster of withdrawals!.
1	is one hell of a sleeping pill. it also makes you feel incredibly high.
1	i think this olanzapine makes me crazier.
1	it's ok, i guess it's just a case of trial and error with antidepressants. coming off venlafaxine has been so nasty
1	i am pretty clumsy and pregabalin makes me clumsier but this door injury was own fault..
1	ok. i'm just going to say it. tmi. my viibryd helps my depression &amp; anxiety, but i have to take immodium like a daily vitamin.
1	paroxetine, may make it hard to have an orgasm.
1	eurgh... metformin why must you hurt my tummy so?!
1	almost vomited on a zinc lozenge
1	bombed on olanzapine. work going to be tricky. days of not drinking coming up. i could sleep all the time atm.
1	rt : restless leg syndrome is bad tonight. damn you fluoxetine.
1	only problem is the ride has fuelled the olanzapine munchies. i was a nightmare in the supermarket tonight!
1	i suggest never stop taking effer abruptly because you will feel like you're on your death bed
1	why can't i sleep like a normal person. oh yeah because i suffer from insomnia and trazodone gives me headaches
1	i think my tablets have made me gain weight. anyone on fluoxetine/prozac?
1	for the first time in ages i've taken gabapentin and paracetamol. i'm sore and i'm emotional... don't mess with me.
1	humira made me have a bad rash on my stomach and broke out with bad psoriasis on my leg. can't wait to start remicade
1	raptiva - caution ! this drug has been recalled due to causing chronic diseases.
1	starving. .. thanks saphris
1	i feel like a drug addict taking seroquel every night.. but oh well, great sleep beats no sleep. except the shitty feeling when you wake up
1	idk if i'm shaking because i took adderall or if it's because i drank red bulls within minutes earlier
1	aw, dude. i've been on both in the past. don't stop fluoxetine suddenly - the withdrawal effects are awful. do it gradually.
1	dat fucking feeling when loperamide didn't stop my fucking diarrhea
1	some people see more blue from double blue cones. also sildenafil side effect.
1	that time that tamiflu bs broke me out in hives!!
1	i take advair to help with breathing , i think it causes hiatic hernia to kick in . i eat too spicy
1	i hate my new medication. it makes me feel hungry
1	who need alcohol when you have gabapentin and tramadol that makes you feel drunk at oclock
1	cuddle with my enbrel so it's my body temp and doesn't hurt as bad
1	hi i was taken enbrel for months but i had to stop it i was getting bad side effects

1	this subone is making me gain weight. i don't know why. but i don't like it. im still active so i don't get it
1	okay, this metoprolol is not a game. aside from the occasional chest pain when i breathe, i'm fine.
1	paxil didn't end up helping. tried prozac and wellbutrin and it helped my mood and anxiety but gave me vertigo.
1	omg i just an enbrel commercial. no don't take it. i take a shot ever friday it make you weak af and your immune system goes down the drain.
1	i couldn't tolerate it so then i went to humira injections. didn't work now i'm on remicade every weeks.
1	"also, ""meth mouth"" is really poverty mouth. u don't c when people take it for adhd. nor in prozac, which similarly dries mouth"
1	i'm too numb to feel, blow out the candle, blindness
1	my mom took lyrica that the doctor prescribed her &amp; now she's having crazy hallicunations
1	i'm not taking my meds tonight. i think latuda makes me hallucinate more than normal. i can't deal with it
1	you forgot the immodium for when the cipro kills all the good bacteria.
1	ok has anyone here taken restoril a pill to help insomnia? i stopped taking ambien, bc i was gaining weight (sleep eating.)

1	at least u can admit it rt : only thing is nuvaring will turn you into an emotionally unstable bitch
1	“: i'm sleepless, you've got me wide awake” my song to vyvanse and mdma
1	nb: not psychotic seroquel used off-label for ptsd. ctl’d many sympts, helped sleep. but side fx - weight gain - caused terrible pain.
1	please be careful when withdrawing from any anti deps, benzos and/or hypnotics. venlafaxine was a bad choice for me and worse withdrawl.
1	oh robitussin dreams are notorious. although what will really turn 'em into a bunuel movie is cipro.

1	so so so shaky. me and effer xr have a love/hate relationship.
1	. at last, a good side effect. couldn't go back on seroquel due to diabetes risk.

1	one of my brothers is addicted to subone &amp; it terrifies me that it could kill him my whole family is on drugs or alcoholics

1	ambien mg qhs, nortriptyline mg qhs, fluphenazine mg qhs, and viibryd mg daily and we're wondering why so somnolent? yeesh.
1	just wondering where the side effect of hating the world is stated on vyvanse advertisements?
1	taking someone off mg off seroquel, mixing it with olanzapine in wks causes psychosis - a proper assess was not done.
1	that is true.... proventil stopped working for me &amp; i'm on nex now...symbicort ...u on maintenance ?
1	cant cope coming off feel like iv got a hangover mixed with flu symptoms. total nausea &amp; i cant keep still. please hurry &amp; pass
1	taking my adderall at in the afternoon was not one of my best decisions.
1	not sure what those meds are, but here in canada they gave me percocet which is a combo of oxycodone &amp; tylenol. it made me feel sick
1	i have been on enbrel for months and eeriencing shortness of breath and lung congestion. anyone else eeriencing this?
1	whoa, on the topamax?! the saphris is what causes my nighttime craziness (haha), topamax cuts off the cravings, keeps me in bed
1	paxil makes it nearly impossible to cry.
1	quetiapine. very low dose even with increase. helps me get to sleep (&amp; eat in general) but feel really groggy in the morning
1	attempts at lamotrigine withdrawal, commuting by train every day and being back at work in a new role
1	i've no probs with porn other than the fact that i've gained pounds on effer and no one needs to see that
1	nicotine headache!
1	thing about venlafaxine is the withdrawals when you're late for a dose - it's like electric shocks in your brain, and they go -
1	so it seems that if i take in am i am drowsy all day. if i take in pm i don’t sleep well. go figure.
1	pristiq did that to me … hideous. and those jerks when you're falling asleep. still get those :/
1	but my hands are shaking from the overdose of ventolin
1	i'm prolly going to because lunesta doesn't work for shit
1	if i put my head down in class and my profs yell at me i'm just gonna scream about how much i dislike viibryd so far
1	thanks am so chuffed, got so big on olanzapine, been working hard for it x
1	year old logic + tamiflu rare side effects of hallucinations = weird night.
1	gabapentin and amitryptylinr made me very drowsy! propanalol made me dizzy (but i have very low blood pressure!).
1	in my case, i had a negative reaction to remicade &amp; humira was the substitute. the pills are just second nature *shrug*
1	seroquel aka wake up at :30 and waste half your day sleeping.
1	my t cell went up w ith humira i also have crohns disease. i wish u guys had more articles with people like me in it
1	first two weeks of olanzapine v drowsy. weight gain was an issue. great for my anxiety though.
1	increased hunger is a side effect of advair smh maybe that's why i've been binge eating and gaining weight
1	“: i run on vyvanse and redbull.” so done with that life. vyvance cooked my brain like a stove top
1	well i just found out that it is indeed possible to abuse imodium and get high off it.
1	i have got to stop taking my vyvanse so late!!
1	no joke! worked like a charm for me, til my immune system went poof. hopeful about
1	crestor and lipitor cholesterol meds have high incidence of muscle/joint pain side effects. ask your loved ones about their muscle pain.
1	i am never taking baclofen and norflex the same day again. first i felt super drowsy but now i feel extremely high and it's freaking me out.
1	"""i'm hereee"" *runs out half asleep, in pjs and hair a wreck* ""thanks dude. adderall saves lives"""
1	it all might be due to restlessness. did make my legs go too!!
1	i hate how vyvanse makes me over think everything and it makes me angry about things that i shouldn't even be angry about
1	tired after the tysabri infusion? i am...
1	thanks to the oxycodone i’ve been in a pretty good dream mode at times today. still not sure if i am real or not.
1	seroquel will kill you. i am going to sue astra zeneca
1	oh yeah! i was on fentanyl but it numbed my brain much. buprenorphine is helping me better w/o making...
1	years ago i was on darvocet post surgery. it made me suicidal. % loss of control of my mind, and it was frightening.
1	victorymy drug choice!! (tysabri) but also found i am jc virus +ve and now panicking. any1 else on tysabri n jvc+ve?
1	yep. pristiq stopped working. i've been phasing off over the last week. these past -5 days have been very rough.
1	abilify for weeks has made me lose /6 of the weight i put on w/seroquel, and i've been eating like shit. i love you abilify!
1	i'm becoming too tolerant to vyvanse
1	lbs in days. obvious now that i should have stopped the quetiapine a long long time ago before i got in this state
1	it wasn't an easy victory though. felt like chemo with the cipro. as for the heart, i meant for study purposes.
1	i'm fine w/ advair &amp; flonase. prednisone = rage monster.
1	and ndt has literally saved my life. levothyroxine was like poison to me, i have no thyroid now and need more than t4 only
1	is a monster that i have taken by the horns and am wrestling to the ground...this time i am winning! thdayfree
1	pah. meh-ness + pregabalin drowsiness &amp; dizziness is making me sloth-like. i've not been able to read a book for weeks. not a good sign.
1	worked a double shift today while dealing with effer withdrawals, i'm a tough bitch; fight me.
1	metformin in my system makes me wanna puke.
1	i once had an allergic reaction to the anti-convulsant lamotrigine. i got a rash all over my body that looked like burns.
1	does anybody else take metformin and has a horrible taste in his mouth?
1	i hope buscopan works.... since loperamide and the other one didn't
1	adderall makes me the happiest person alive...and then it wares off and turns me into a horrible person. lol night and day.
1	the comedown on adderall is so fucking annoying
1	i have suffered severe reaction to infliximab after th one so had to stop. humira is next step in uk
1	"pt with similar found out trazodone can do the same. md said it was common. ""trazodone gives you a bone"". he is a poet."
1	where are y'all. good grief! i didn't even get one reply... discrimination! guess my parents don't matter. vioxx killed mom.
1	my afluria site is actually hurting tonight and temp is up .5 degrees. doubt i'm going to be staying up much longer
1	6 day rivaroxaban diary. much better than yesterday. still neck, back, hip, and leg aches but not so intense.
1	leathers and of geodon later.... we had a sleepy crackhead
1	i take a mg vyvanse and focalin and feel nothing...
1	well,yesterday was rubbish(post humira)all day in bed,loads of pain etc.just got up and i think i'm alright?give it an hour and reassess lol
1	im on the codiene lean oxy hydro pill trazodone ah man loud n moscato vision blurry still alot on deck fuck everybody im rollin
1	no one likes me on my vyvanse
1	on today's ride i burnt calories. take that olanzapine you hunger inducing bastard!!!
1	so while i'm letting the thoughts of lamictal/fatal rashes/tonsillectomy/spinal tap settle, i'm going to go rescue a budgie.
1	the moment i realized my nose is irritated because i took loperamide instead of loratidine.
1	just don't sleep since increase of my nexavar dose.
1	both, humira and remicade doesn't help, so i think an operation and a stoma or how do you call it in english?
1	anesthesia got me constipated so bad bout to call the burroaks for some of that miralax
1	trazodone hangovers are the worst, though. sigh
1	i was literally on percocet darvacet motrin and vicodin. nothing. made it better. nothing.
1	darvocet worked for me, but it makes my heart beat all over the place, like a john bonham solo.
1	i started taking adderall again everyday for the past two weeks and i'm already losing weight
1	i'm on the remicade. hope humira works for you. i can't get rid of the dry skin thts my only problem so far.
1	just took seroquel. now i'm freaking out that i will end up sleeping hrs and miss my pm appt tomorrow
1	starting humira tomorrow. i wonder if it will make me tired for a day or so like remicade did. if it works, it's worth it.
1	just about dead, think it's bedtime.. fuck you quetiapine
1	it's so frustrating when everything is so blurry. i should've listened when it warned me about morphine and ditropan
1	they think the crestor i take is causing my knee pain.
1	it has nothing to do with any of that~ apparently seroquel makes you gain alot of weight -__-
1	oh i hate that! i used to be on citalopram, it stopped working eventually. sometimes i have to up my effer dose temporarily.
1	i wish i could be tired. shouldn't have taken the vyvanse. now i'm never sleeping.
1	i take pristiq and i have headache do you think of it?
1	me too. i am more or less fine on my periods then nuvaring just made me a total mess the first month. it cooled down tho.
1	synthroid will not work for me. i need them to pay for armour
1	popped a vyvanse i'm tweak. whoop
1	with darvocet at first my ass cheeks went numb, then my forehead, then my thighs, then finally my uterus was numb. yippee
1	metformin can create disabling tummy problems. my mother was long term diabetic, when she got really sick we moved in with /2
1	i find the baclofen worse, it has left me in a tired/sleepy fog all day - the codeine i can (mostly) deal with.
1	so i took a adderall last night...i'm still awake.
1	i've had no appetite since i started on prozac, i guess that's a good thing
1	i took my trazodone like an hour ago and i can barely keep my eyes open and i need to finish homeworrrkkk
1	trazodone made me extremely angry and i was wide awake all the time
1	natural don't work for me, try mg of seroquel...you'll sleep for days, i have insomnia that's what they give me lol
1	yea the humira should definitely help, that or remicade! just let her know the shot itself doesn't hurt but the fluid burns
1	my tolerance for my trazodone goes up every few days
1	seem to be feeling a bit better. disturbed sleep is a problem though.
1	i just get pain back if i forget to change fentanyl patch. buprenorphine withdrawal was awful for about weeks. never again!
1	- take a baby aspirin w/the tecfidera or when you eerience side effects like flushing. -4 oz of applesauce w/pill also helps.
1	this new medication is kicking my ass. and i feel flushed. hope i make it through the night. restoril is not playing around
1	seroquel will make you sleep for hours.
1	(triggering) so... i'm taking quetiapine and tramadol pre-cutting. i'm allergic to tramadol...this should be interesting
1	i've been on paxil for years for depression/anxiety and at first it used to help but i guess i've built up tolerance and i come too fast.
1	take first pristiq tablet for weeks. immediately feel sick.
1	yup quetiapine. the normal dose at night whacks me out. i'd have been asleep til friday on double
1	the effer may have been pushing me toward hypomania, so we are trying just an ssri, then see if a mood stabilizer is needed.
1	seroquel?? hell i take half of the lowest dosage and i am knocked on my ass!!
1	i recently stopped taking effer what can i do to ease my withdrawls?i feel miserable right now and very angry.please any ideas
1	same with venlafaxine, user i spoke to yrs ago stopped taking that when she started having acid like trips losing hours at a time
1	boniva would've been better properly named as an erectile dysfunction drug.
1	okay my doctor tried to perscribe me strattera instead of adderall and i couldn't tell him that strattera doesn't work ugh
1	yes, humira didn't work for me and i lost a ton of hair on it i've been on remicade since surgery in ..been in remission
1	i hate cipro!
1	as are (probably) the nausea, headache, sweats, flu symptoms &amp; diarrhea. but it’s still better than being on it.
1	my enbrel shots hurt a lot less than my back but i still dread them. my brain makes no sense. lol.
1	yeaa bihh all jacked up on vyvanse!
1	can reducing fluoxetine zap me of all energy?i've reduced from a high dose, now on standard does &amp; not feeling good at all.
1	starting an imodium routine. not my favorite drug.
1	i've taken a temazepam so struggling to say what i mean clearly sorry
1	-nods- my zombie-ness when i first wake up in the morning is mostly from my nightly meds too (seroquel).
1	for all you my meds are completely legal and i'm stoked to be on vyvanse cause strattera was worsening my depression. so
1	i think i'm that too! had rare breastmilk production on quetiapine, ultra rare hallucinations (not psychosis) on valproate.
1	rt : does paxil withdrawal take! extremely emotional switched to wellbutrin. wanna crawl in a hole.
1	lose potency or we get immunity to them remicade cimzia now humira friend
1	thank you! i hope i don't have an allergic reaction like saphris and zyprex. choking is no fun.
1	mm, i'm wary of trying new meds after a really bad reaction to fluoxetine, but i've heard a lot of good things about citalopram
1	although my bitching about being fat did look a but comical next to my brother, with his olanzapine induced weight gain.
1	ok brain &amp; body. we need a chat about oversleeping and overeating since taking olanzapine again
1	the seroquel is addictive a d they deny it.
1	i'm having to pee way too much this drive.. drinking too much water. fuck you mg vyvanse and your ability to dehydrate the fuck out of me.
1	i haven't been diagnosed with pots but i do have orthostatic hypotension which they say is a side effect of namenda
1	alright time to find out if a shit ton of vyvanse and not sleeping for days can get a trimester worth of homework done for classes
1	also told me i was imagining agitation from lyrica because she hasn't heard anyone say it.it's common effect
1	oh, and if you have fillings, consider prescription strength toothpaste - mucodyne &amp; tiotropium both reduce dental defences.
1	need to switch bc def allergic to cymbalta
1	ventolin makin me all anxious. alone in the house and lost in the world. get hype
1	well, the humira failed. will be moving to remicade, and hopefully getting out of here soon. sigh. onwards.
1	minus the skin reactions, this week i can say i think enbrel is helping
1	"fda needs a warning label for vyvanse: ""use of of this drug may result in major ocd/many unneeded hours at work"""
1	omerprazole actually didn't work for me at all...nexium worked but insurance didn't cover it. dexilant is helping though
1	hours until i swallow and entire pack of seroquel and hallucinate whilst i watch got's.
1	found out that diclofenac i took today is q painkiller u get for cancer and post operations. holy shit. nae wunner i was tuned to the moon
1	weeks sober today. have had cravings but no where near as intense as when i was on antipsychotic seroquel. convinced of connection.
1	subone got me on cloud
1	i swear this vimpat pill gonna make me go blind
1	rt : i don't know whether my vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my vyvanse addiction.
1	really bad idea to eat chili for dinner when your sick to you stomach. and never taking metformin in the morning again.
1	going to add in atomoxetine for adhd, but due to strain on heart, have to lower venlafaxine :'(
1	whenever i use my ventolin lately i shake i hate it i also hate that i haven't had to use it for like yrs and now im using it almost daily
1	i always plan on eating breakfast, and then i wake up &amp; take my vyvanse...
1	i feel for you, i had the sane eerience of disturbed sleep &amp; bad dreams on venlafaxine xx
1	like, adderall butchered my ability to concentrate and made me angry all the time while strattera was almost perfect for me.
1	that geodon withdrawl starts fuckin fast
1	saphris makes my mouth numb i can't deal with this shit.
1	that's what i get but the bloody quetiapine made me so bloody miserable.
1	i came off pristiq in july last year. i still get brain zaps when tired. my genitals aren’t numb now tho - swings/roundabouts
1	ok. it's the chill that worrys me, i take pregabalin morphine paracetamol. ...&amp; ipubrofane if u don't take never get chill&gt;
1	oxycodone dreams had me screaming and laughing in my sleep.
1	i can't even fucking restrict anymore. i just eat, and eat. maybe it's bc of the zyprexa. the other med should help with that, but idk.
1	levaquin sucks. blinding headaches. vomiting. diarrhea. time for my next dose. happy weekend.
1	i'm reducing duloxitine (been on yr) and slowly increasing m but slept -14 hrs solid and still feel wasted
1	also my kidneys have been swollen ever since i've been on viibryd.. but its also been super hot out..
1	only neg side effect i get from gabapentin is drowsiness; doesn't work great for pain, but strangely, it's more effective for
1	feel proud of myself for writing up my august favourites today even though i had my tysabri infusion and feel like shit.
1	i sure wish my doctor had told me cipro could disable me for life! there was never any mention of that. now i'm crippled.
1	i've been so tired since i started the cymbalta. i sleep so much. case in point: just slept an hour before bed.
1	your lucky! i have to do infusions of remicade for my ra. i would happily do humera or enbrel if it didnt make me stop breathin
1	trying not to worry, but this tysabri is a scary drug. hope it's just a bug
1	i tried subone twice... had a weird reaction to it both times. va dr sent me to clinic.
1	not to mention the thousands of people online who say they’ve stacked on the weight due to taking seroquel.
1	hi the side effects can be really bad ive been through lots.i am ok thanks ive only just started pregabalin bit numb though
1	i start on tues b/c of so i know. it helped but it then destroyed my lungs.
1	i take trazodone for my &amp; still have a hard time falling asleep or i end up having crazy dreams that wake me up!?!
1	"humira commercial: ""this is humira giving me my life back"" mom: ""this is humira giving me anal leakage"""
1	i took a mg oxycodone once i get out this tub i shud be hella knocked
1	i got miralax and now i have a serve headache
1	got off the heroin with subone then just built an addiction to that and can't get off em. when will it ever stop
1	question: recently i have been hyper-sensitive to different textures, does anyone know if this is a bipolar / lamotrigine thing??
1	oooo here is the part of the tysabri infusion when i’m cold. don’t like this bit at all.
1	"and ""we"" eected and stated vioxx was safe and effective. reduced swelling and caused attacks"
1	oxycontin is a long acting oxycodone product that can cause constipation
1	mri done of legs, hope the effects of levaquin are not permanent, is not improving. be aware of rx fluoroquinolone type side effects
1	well. i abruptly stopped taking lamotrigine (lamictal), and that is why i am having the pain and weakness. possible seizure. oops.
1	i had to get off lipitor. i hurt so bad i couldn't even get out of bed changed to crestor not as bad ur in my prayers
1	don't ever take a vyvanse and drink an energy drink. your heart will elode
1	my old ones took days for withdrawals but effer which i'm on now i will get them the next day :/ i wish i could email you valium
1	i decided to try visualization tapes again. at least they wouldn't give me a rash like lamictal.
1	i essentially felt nothing on them. great for anxiety, bad for living. coming off klonopin and paxil was hell though.
1	popped a zinc lozenge, i'm sweatin
1	off venlafaxine which was pure hell for me, i can't switch these meds anymore, tired of feeling like shit all day.
1	jane's boniva addiction
1	i can't sleep thanks pristiq
1	i had panic and aniexty orders a few years ago before i took paxil but i never freaked out on ppl and cried hysterically
1	lalalalala.. clearly i've underestimated my vyvanse by choosing to take it in the middle of the day.
1	rt : almost blew out my arms &amp; heels work. they hurt like hell. &amp; the pain is spreading, damned cipro.
1	headache &amp; stomach ache. i'm never forgetting my effer again.
1	advair is disgusting. in case you were wondering. it gobs up in my throat and i gag like the cat trying to hack up a hairball.
1	thank god i was born with so much hair; i wouldn't been bald by now.
1	do i come off my medication or do i just continue to be a prozac zombie
1	the is kicking in. bizarre thoughts tonight. tempted to take the whole lot. i won't - don't worry people. just odd thoughts.
1	it's not even pm and i'm already feeling the venlafaxine withdrawal. stupid bitch. how hard is it to pack the bloody tablets?!
1	vyvanse at pm probably wasn't a great idea.. i can't sleeeep -__-
1	has anyone tried the humira shot, i heard it feels like hot lava going thru your skin for the first seconds but my doctor wants me to get it
1	cymbalta makes me thirsty to the point where my mouth is painfully dry. it feels like the sahara desert in my mouth.
1	hi i'm using enbrel too but it didn't work
1	i used to dream every night without fail on fluoxetine...i have no crazy stories each morning now i'm off it though!! :-l
1	thanks i so wanted venlafaxine to work cos at least it didn’t increase my appetite like citalopram did.
1	's vioxx was rushed through by the fda, too - and killed my husband. testing results were distorted, hidden. fda was complicit.
1	the fda killed ,000 americans due to vioxx scam and gave ,000 heart attacks..! more deaths than from al-qaeda..
1	i would like to know what everyone else's eerience are of baclofen and clonazepam. do they get dry nose / throat?
1	promise, brownies honor i'm not stupid, i have been forgetting everything lately
1	why do i not remember going to bed or waking up (the answer: probably seroquel)
1	nah, subone it's cool, iont ever wanna sleep again ever anyways bro.. just keep doing ya thing bruh
1	starting to crash from my adderall
1	i've found that it's okay to stop dead with prozac but not fluoxetine - i got terrible paraesthesia; it felt as though i was
1	metformin is keeping my energy low
1	combining them with the quetiapine makes me hallucinate :/
1	lamictal withdrawal update: starving!
1	rivaroxaban diary day . am beginning to think all pains from pressure on that part of body are due to fluid retention.
1	i just had a look buddy, and my medication (seroquel) does affect tolerance to the sun.
1	rivaroxaban /2 lower back pain. not very pc but am crippled by this drug. taking more paracetamols. must ring for 'phone consultation.
1	i hated effer. it makes you hungry, dizzy, and lethargic. that culminated in a large weight gain for me.
1	time for my commute. wondering if i'm going to cope with this everyday. it's like wading through treacle getting up so early on olanzapine
1	that sucks. humira made me so sick. remicade helped a but, but then seizures put that out. now waiting, just prednisone now.
1	i would think so because adderall makes you not want to eat even more? probably get sick maybe
1	so i ran out of victoza before payday &amp; restarted it yesterday. bleh: nausea. it did help me lose lbs. but i found when i ran out.
1	oh that was only last night when i was delirious on quetiapine - you took advantage of the situation.
1	"apparently, baclofen greatly exacerbates the ""ad"" part of my adhd. average length of focus today: about seconds."
1	oh yuck. we all have our least favorite body fluid. mine is aerosolized blood. nosebleed on xarelto -eeeew
1	my son has been on lamictal for yrs n broke out in a rash when he st was put on it. luckily after going to er it was not the sj
1	i didn't have side effects when i started taking cymbalta. after about mths had to stop because it raised my blood pressure.
1	dissociative fugues &amp; loss of empathy since age , serious cardio problems since age , almost dying of paxil withdrawal , that's a-ok
1	my daughter reckoned she had it, i think it was the tamiflu tabs that made her ill, really bad for wks
1	feel crap every morning. wake up after another restless night and just want to cry.
1	umm, are you being a smart-ass? dont mess with me right now. going through cymbalta withdrawal i think &amp; im very depressed.
1	i've self-induced brain fog atm cos o amount of buprenorphine i've taken to get thru pain &amp; injuries from cleaning &amp; packing
1	i'm taking mg pregablin and mg duloxetine hence why i'm totally mashed
1	i can relate to the olanzapine lbs, but you'll be great!
1	0 day rivaroxaban diary. headache over right side of head; lower back pain. wrote letter to my gp &amp; his colleague outlining problems
1	i have psoriatic arthritis .. was on enbrel and that stopped working so on humira now for over a year.
1	this seroquel is hitting me soo hard with this beer
1	"sildenafil in high doses reported to have caused blindness - no wonder people always say ""love causes blindness"""
1	sorry for jumping in. trying to get up for work after night seroquel is a nightmare!
1	alcohol and oxycodone to make me float in the o-zone
1	after the lunesta kicks in, i'll forget everything. lol
1	same lol didn't eat a thing, damn vyvanse
1	restless arms &amp; legs! blood quetiapine :-/
1	5 rivaroxaban diary day . aches easing, back pain easing. swollen lower legs like fluid retention. i take mg. furosemide every a.m.
1	damn you quetiapine side effect. was quite enjoying being able to sleep at night
1	hey not sleeping.
1	i'm still awake because apparently even lunesta can't take me out. but in reality ---- that's me dying from sleep deprivation.
1	def vicodin lol i'm on oxycodone that shit knocks me tf out i'll be talking then i just pass out lol
1	i might have gained lbs in weeks on zyprexa...haven't lost that weight yet, and it's been years now. call doc if it happens to you.
1	god i'd like to go to sleep right now. but i'm still a little afraid of the visions, even though i stopped taking viibryd days ago.
1	synthroid is causing freq afi. what is my alternative???
1	consider nuvaring or orthomicronor (the mini pill) bc they both cause less weight gain!
1	this new baccy is just making my cough so much worse but ahhh well need my nicotine
1	nuvaring is seriously so easy and i haven't had any issues with it at all. the depo shot makes you gain a lot of weight.
1	not sure the paxil is working any more
1	didnt take my fluoxetine this morning because i forgot and i've been so shaky and tired all day, is this like, withdrawal symptoms?
1	geez this vyvanse makes me talk a mile a minute haha
1	jalapeño cheddar cheetos and a coke to chase my adderall so i don't vom.
1	coming off mg venlafaxine over days was a better idea in discussion. my brain feels like its actually vibrating!
1	i took victoza and the sick feeling does ease and stop. i found taking in evening helped.
1	i had terrible joint pain with remicade. i switched to humira and have had no major side effects.
1	i have been on amisulpride but only for a few days, i could not tolerate nausea and akathisia, olanzapine i can cope with
1	fuck you, effer. dilated pupils and blurry vision and nausea and headaches? this is awful!
1	im delaying on taking my geodon so i can stay up late
1	doc for panic disorders: alprazolam (addictive) and paroxetine (sedating).
1	i take way too much zoloft and seroquel to get the horn my life is a lie
1	... gabapentin can cause you to get very hungry. just be prepared. amitriptyline...just ease slowly and use a low dose.
1	i switched to humira in feb. i was on remicade for yrs. it worked wonders at first but my body stopped responding
1	yeah pregabalin calms my bipolar ii too - but not in the numbing way that prozac does.
1	infliximab worked for only a short time, humira wasn't effective at all, i suffer from crohns and uc. there's only one real cure
1	"talk to your doctor to see if you need to up your dose of paroxetine. it is possible to ""plateau"" on it..i did."

1	dear alternative medicine aficionados, don't do intra-nasal acupuncture when you're on effient and aspirin.
1	the difference between 'just tired' and 'tired &amp; in a fog' is amazing. so happy to be done taking levaquin, that stuff is way too strong
1	i appreciate it. i gained over lbs with paxil so i'm trying something different, tired of the appetite side effects.
1	i was addicted to prescription drugs, namely codeine, put on subone a substitute and saw that as replacing an addiction for another
1	i can't take this i thought having seroquel would make it easier but nope. my whole body feels like i have raw nerve endings going crazy
1	took adderall and got my homework done quicker than eected now i cant sleep
1	remember . vioxx costs $65m to ontario drug benefit: x more than ibuprofen, slightly more effective and was linked to heart attacks!
1	took too many hits of ventolin this morning and am now remembering why i don't smoke crack anymore
1	oof, sympathies. i had a raging cipro headache last week.
1	i felt drugged on ritalin. i love vyvanse. i can't tell i'm on it except for feeling better and calmer and more structured
1	the cipro in you eyes burns but works its buffered for your ears seems stupid but if they take your life take it back
1	"""prozac and paxil have the same effects."" well, shit. no wonder i fucking have insomnia after i told him i have it."

1	"""no taste for you"" -vyvanse"
1	so i may be allergic to the metoprolol. rash on my face. needing my inhaler daily since friday.
1	my body is so not ready for this seroquel. never had an antidepressant knock me the fuck out at a quarter dose before o _o
1	so apparently mgs of prozac will make you scared of eating gmo's and make you think you need to save the world! switching back to mgs!!!
1	i try to be sexy, sad or quiet. so i'm ranting about how the antibiotic levaquin has caused me permanent nerve damage over
1	husband said i was a little 'high' tonight so encouraged me to take mg of olanzapine. now feel really really really sleepy, zzzz....
1	all i have to say is cipro will mess you up kids. don't get sick!
1	taking mg of saphris last night was the most monumentally stupid idea ever. i didn't sleep until 0am and the day is a write off
1	been dealing with some not so lovely side effects from the metformin lately. the constant lingering threat of digestive upset is not fun.
1	i was on celexa, which made me sleepy. i switched to effer. it has norepinephrine in it, so it jump starts me in the mornin
1	as an adult i was on adderall along with zoloft and chantix. i was so angry and confused and depressed i couldn’t function.
1	been on humira now short period to injections no noticeable change in pain but racing heart and palpitations. mtx at ml injection.
1	when im tweaked off vyvanse i cant go into my room...cuse if i look at my shoes ill lose focus of everything and just think bout them
1	fingers crossed i have been taken off tysabri because my body is resisting it ha typical hope you are doing ok
1	cymbalta tore up our stress incontinence agreement first! it’s like niagara falls when i cough.

1	in need of a dream interpreter.. is really having an affect on my night visions.. some fucked up scenarios in my sleep lol :-/
1	i'm having brain zaps and stomach cramps from stopping meds oxycontin is an evil drug even in moderation and effer hurts my brain ugh!
1	i didn't take a zopiclone in the end.. but i'm third day of no quetiapine &amp; i'm eating incredibly differently!
1	this lunesta has me feeling half retarded i can't move my body right i think it's time i went to sleep
1	my battle continues with olanzapine weight gain with a bowl of porridge and a am bootcamp
1	horrendous venlafaxine dream. indecently assaulted by rose west and myra hindley.
1	: any ideas on treating depression naturally paxil is making me gain unwanted pounds and water weight...thanks
1	the gabapentin is making me tired and the tramadol is making me light headed. am ok if busy but if not....
1	ssris were great for me for ages, not working as well now. thus seroquel. i’m also on clonazepam, makes me sleepy too.
1	it's called lamotrigine, i'm pretty sure the mix of them both is making me sick. i don't think bipolar &amp; add mix very well..
1	second day off effer &amp; on viibryd here. brain zaps are fun. and by fun, i mean horrendous &amp; miserable.
1	olanzapine. i was taking mg and that was a nightmare, now taking mg but the weight still keeps coming
1	rt : hungover shakes + vyvanse shakes + coffee = recipe for success
1	lls it's cool. u could try lunesta but that shit leaves a bad after taste. you'll wake up inna morning with it and everythin
1	venlafaxine withdrawal is worse than most by miles x
1	if has hurt your liver, avoid tylenol always, as it further damages liver, eat grapefruit unless taking cardiac drugs
1	coming off cymbalta sucks, i've been slowly cutting back for the past months. have finally made it over a weeks since i have taken it.
1	lunesta makes everything taste like underfunk. oh. and it obviously didn't work.
1	albuterol is like my crack cocaine, except that is won't kill me, and it makes normal ppl feel like they are freaking out!
1	this oxycodone finna knock me out ..
1	since vioxx killed my mother highly suggest persons who notice change in loved one, friend, anyone investigate adverse reactions.
1	i was on muscle relaxant baclofen for two weeks, then months trying to rid myself of it. days in without and no sleep. :/
1	no stomach probs for me, thank goodness. before this i was on viibryd &amp; my stomach was a mess!!
1	i reflect on the tension in my nerves and all the shaking... meditation helped me a lot.
1	my medication is making me stupid, brain meds are not ok , fuck u paxil
1	the injectables do. was very sick with betaseron. baclofen is a pill and it just makes me drowsy like gabapentin for nerve pain
1	only issue with lyrica is weight gain and swelling.
1	anyone on cymbalta it is making me like a zombie and still hating the world.
1	after taking olanzapine i wake up and feel like i am in a straight jacket because my muscles feel stiff
1	i love this effer! majorly kills my libido.
1	merck was sued for $6b because man died of a heart attack using vioxx and this was after years of trials and usage.
1	thinking it might be the baclofen doing it.only on a low dose though.broken sleep is a nightmare.
1	whenever i take loperamide i feel great that day but always feel awful the following day, anyone else the same?
1	while stuck with kaiser permanente, i cant even switch to any oral med when i have to stop tysabri because i'm jcv+ and they dont allow it.
1	playing league while on vyvanse is too damn stressful. back to public i go!
1	thanks. there is a nonzero chance that the discomfort i am feeling was caused by going back on cymbalta, possibly too quickly.
1	thanks seeing rheumy april , i just think i maxed out my neurontin &amp; it's not working anymore:/
1	does telmisartan [e.g telma(40) without any diuretic] cause hyponatremia by any chance?
1	i think i'm gong to speak my gp about reducing quetiapine dosage. the weight gain from it is scaring the hell out of me.
1	i was on keppra for awhile,i had terrible mood swings while i was on it.im on vimpat now,and dehydration is a major thing.
1	this prolonged release metformin isn't working so well.
1	okay, mg of memantine a day seems to have stopped the worst of the panic attacks. now i just had no motivation. :/
1	okay, if there is no association between efavirenz and suicide, why are my friends on efv trying to kill themselves?
1	i hated seroquel, i was sleeping hrs a day on it
1	i've had ocd symptoms like that for a while but seems like the seroquel exacerbates things and now this. :\
1	i am on gabapentin and i feel drunk. and it is hideous. drunk is not something i enjoy. the irony oh the irony.
1	who knew gabapentin got you off your face. i'm completely off my nut!!! so calm.
1	owww. i hurt my foot. &amp; am concerned. st warning on cipro is tendon damage. :-/ it certainly wasn't a rupture. i'm sure i'm just paranoid.
1	yeah i hear epilim is pretty tough, sorry to hear re bad times with it oddly, dear sweet lamotrigine tipped me to a dark place
1	is the best mum. i'm craving pizza.... think it was the extra diclofenac that's given me munchies.
1	i have been on most meds. humira did a number on me. infliximab never really helped and i developed reaction as most people do
1	okay, can't take lunesta now and get up on time so please mellow me out and get sleepy ms. xanax. gotta be able to be fun and loud tomorrow!
1	i've decided i'm really not happy with the pain lamotrigine is causing or the poor sleep. i am thinking of asking for a trial of prozac and
1	rt : vyvanse, commonly known as ocd in a pill.
1	nonstop sneezing. darn it ventolin
1	i had an allergic reactoon tp that drug. along with remicade, colazal, nexium, and simponi
1	racing next sun so thought i'd better try on my tri suit. so depressing, can just about get into it and look like a whale ffs!!
1	day : the initial lamotrigine lethargy kicked in the day before exams. i tell myself that possible failure is better than possible death.
1	darvacet was taken off the market because yrs later they say it causes heart attack, yeah but to abusers of the drug. it's a good pill.
1	it's disgusting how they portray it, i delayed starting methadone for far too long when subone wasn't working because of stigma.
1	lunesta really does work but they make my mouth taste like hot buttered ass in the mornings.
1	days on &amp; i'm still recovering from my first etonogestrel reinsertion.. what a girl will go through to not get pregnant these days!
1	getting off seroquel (sero-kill) can cause convulsions, fever, toxic reactions, psychotic reactions. and other shit
1	6 day rivaroxaban diary. particularly bad lower back ache had not eased by 0 so went to bed. much better when i woke at 0.
1	i can go without nicotine for a few day but by the time the third day comes around i want to rip out my teeth
1	seriously about to be done with this damn geodon and ask my doctor if i can go back to lamictol. at least then i'm not so damn sleepy /7.
1	weird thing about paxil: feeling fully awake and energized and feeling completely tired and half-asleep at the same time.
1	yes, i go in tomorrow for more testing but it's been years of pain. remicade, humira both failed to work.
1	really??? i will check her out right now ... lyrica didn't work, celebrex &amp; nsaids hurt my stomach, cymbalta does just ok
1	i loved fluoxetine (prozac) but it made me lose my temper of the slightest thing but that was the only downside.
1	synthroid completely kills my energy levels and armour thyroid makes my heart beat rapidly. think i'll just stay in bed all winter
1	it has been a good day today after a rough week of tecfidera flushing. let's hope for a good night's sleep.
1	seroquel thoughts
1	geodon is deff beating me sdsyt today im already so sleepy
1	the misery i'm eeriencing today from the pain, outweighs the anti-depressant effect of the lamotrigine
1	actually i have! spoke gp abt pregabalin as mood very flat &amp; not helping pain so going change it.dropped last night &amp;...
1	i finally had an appetite, made food, gone. humira why won't you let me eat
1	my mind races when i'm on a vyvanse
1	subone withdrawals
1	i've been giving her fiber tablets daily for days and before that miralax but miralax makes her puke. i'm just gonna die
1	i clock in at stone (added stone since quetiapine) and according to that bmi thing i'm obese, which i'm clearly not.
1	i feel like the nuvaring is making me super bitchy
1	0 day rivaroxaban diary. thanks to paracetamol and hot water bottle i had hrs continuous sleep. woke uo with frontal headache, /2
1	as effective as enbrel is on my i really could do without the second-day hangover.
1	oh a bit better! and a bit worse :/ desvenlafaxine is working for me but the mouth and stomach ulcers aren't very nice.
1	probably a month ago after i started taking the viibryd i began tumbling out of dreams into a half conscious state
1	i had sleep paralysis every night for four months when i took quetiapine in addition to lamotrigine
1	i wish everyone i loved wasn't addicted to nicotine.
1	it was! supposed to take synthroid but it doesn't help &amp; i'm vit d deficient. so that has a lot to do with it also i think
1	i take qvar x a day. singulair gave me nightmares and advair made weird things grow out my skin, itching burning too :-/
1	too much vyvanse.... not sleeping tonight
1	"""a slimming coffee that could give serious side effects because it contains the active sibutramine substance"""
1	0 day rivaroxaban diary woken up with pains in head, neck, back, hip and legs. seeing doc in hours. no way am i continuin with rvxn
1	young nigga just gave me a mg vyvanse, these things can twerk me out thank goodness for my script of xanax
1	oh for fuck's sake. my mouth is bleeding again. can't blame the gabapentin this time. what the fuck???
1	omfg this metformin is not agreeing with my stomach one bit
1	wow paxil sent me into a huge hypo manic mixed episode.
1	i used to be on paxil but that made me more depressed and prozac made me angry
1	permanent side effect: happened to me after using darvocet after a series of many knee surgeries. that's how i know.
1	holy shit, that trazodone actually knocked me the fuck out and took me for a ride
1	: after the last days i have come to the conclusion that withdrawing from pristiq must be like coming off heroin, fuuuuck
1	note to self: do not take and together. i'm a space cadet today!
1	tamiflu has a side effect which includes vomiting. i'm not sure that is helping.
1	trying to study for my midterm while taking oxycontin and oxycodone isn't my best idea
1	going off paxil cr cold turkey is something you should never ever do if you value your brain cells.
1	lamictal nap ft. cups of caffeinated coffee
1	and then i had horrible sleep once i took the trazodone. i just couldn't win, haha.
1	2 day rivaroxaban diary. haven't yet taken today's tablet. will when i eat. still intense lower back pain from yesterday's tablet.
1	i guess viibryd has a short half life, bc i feel like hell.
1	i hate how this fibro and gabapentin robs me if my life...i just hate feeling so useless and worthless — feeling tired
1	ugh. my partner was on paxil for a while. it made him hide in the apartment. :/
1	bedtime. hopefully the headache and nausea from the levaquin will be gone leaving me with only the more common side effects of antibiotics.
1	i lost pounds on vyvanse &amp; that's why life is wonderful
1	this oxycodone gets me so high but itchy at the same time
1	dizzy, out if it and confused on the drugs. upping the baclofen slowly now as i seem better on these.
1	omfg i just had to take an imodium and at first i couldn't swallow it but now i have this weird taste in my mouth. it's not that bad though.
1	i remember i took mg of geodon on accident and slept for like hours
1	personally i prefer staying up until i get hallucinations, to taking seroquel to get to sleep, but only because it's more fun for me
1	oh and did i tell you i took mg of temazepam since i didn't fall asleep i'm high yay me
1	no. it turns out one of the less advertised side effects of this casually prescribed viibryd is haunting dreams and demon visions.
1	headaches suck i wanna curl up &amp; cry.
1	pros and cons of medication. dilemma: have been taking oxybutynin for hyperhidrosis. works very well, but drys out eyes &amp; mouth severely.
1	i just have to remember that what i'm feeling is the withdrawal from the venlafaxine. when my meds come, i will get better.
1	headache? check! forget to refilll uloric script? check!
1	was taking gilenya but it didn't sit in me very well. went off it, new lesions, now i'm trying aubagio blood tests first tho.
1	i wish i'd have found your article sooner! i was crippled by cipro in oct of '09. prescribed for a uti &amp; it didn't even help.
1	they've got him on fucking subone but he's acting like he's on coke
1	getting ready to go to dr today to see if viibryd is causing nightmares, a1c and several other small things
1	is mtx called methotrexate ? if so i was on that pill but it didn't help. she wants me on humira or enbrel etc. but not now
1	i need more energy today. don't know where to get it from, though. this is the result of going off for and heat-related.
1	also so glad they gave me percocets instead of t3s. oxycodone helps so much more than codeine. inb4 opiate withdrawels though.
1	i have no idea what loritidine is - but advair and albuterol make my heart rate soar and hands all jittery - it sucks
1	i don't think this ventolin shit is working any more.
1	trazodone isn't working. can't take seroquel at am or i won't wake up until after pm. stuck, painfully awake.
1	i've had ten tysabri infusions and i feel sick each and every time i get them for a few days up to a week. is this my life now?
1	trying to force myself to sleep on adderall is fucking impossible.
1	- whilst i was maxed on tegretol, neurontin &amp; lyrica for pain management, my memory and decision-making ability were all shot
1	that's not good. i have full digestive tract issues. stomach is the worst though. remicade didn't work &amp; humira is failing.
1	after a 'friendship' since childhood, i can't believe that ventolin and seretide have now decided to work against me.
1	how the hell does miralax in coffee not work??
1	things which are the spawn of satin: mosquitoes, bananas, facebook, paxil withdrawal symptoms.
1	i think baclofen might make me a bigger asshole than usual. :/
1	don't know if it's monday, fighting this cellulitis, or the enbrel vaca but i am exhausted. too tired to sit kind of fatigue.
1	pre subone i could cum like times a day no joke but i'll trade a lifetime of orgasms to never touch heroin again
1	not getting any better here so dragging myself to gp. i'd rather be mad than comatose! hope ur doing ok
1	i eat my trazodone and go to bed; wake up in the morning with holes in my head
1	i was on humira a while back and worked ok bit then stopped being so effective. infliximab on the other hand is amazing for..
1	- i was on humira but after a big eye flair (iritis) that happens with as he changed to remicade it's working great
1	protip: don't take tamiflu with an empty stomach. it'll make you feel really nauseous.
1	i've probably gained a good seven or eight pounds on paxil. my '2 and small frame can't deal w that. lol get me off the crazy meds asap!!!
1	good luck! i have been such an insomniac lately and even my lunesta isn't working! sleep tight gorgeous!
1	trazodone has screwed up my sleep schedule. its helping tho.
1	pre loaded and not as fun to inject as enbrel sure click but doesn't kill my immune system as bad &amp; helps my intestinal issues
1	0 day rivaroxaban diary. neck ache and lower back pain. had to kneel on floor to get out of bed.
1	r u on any meds? my dreams on seroquel are fucked up
1	gonna watch the sunrise.. vyvanse got me up. i have only slept about hours in the past hours. mg got me fucked up
1	i hope i'm making sense i accidently took lunesta and my brain is mush.
1	it feels like my brain is melting. mg of vyvanse in hours... not smart danielle. not smart.
1	i can stay up later with less geodon and less zoloft but then i can't fall asleep and want to stay in bed all day. this has been my week
1	i’m going to try for sleep. real sleep. not that light bastard that brings me.
1	i had a terrible eerience with nuvaring which almost ended... very badly... and when i told me doc about it, she said she'd never
1	luckily i had spare keppra and vimpat on me phew! i was given lorazapam for status a few months ago.. lost days of my life!
1	i'm on the twitter-machine tonight cuz can't walk or do anything else tonight. boosted neurontin dose has my motor control jacked up. :-|

1	thats the prob with zyprexa its for ppl with bi-polar or schizophrenia its really strong when you wake up your drowsy for hrs
1	months of no treatment. went back to my original rheumy and she's trying to get me back on remi. i was allergic to enbrel
1	rt : since quetiapine's messed with my prolactin levels, making my boobs humungous &amp; my bras so eensive, i want a lingerie…
1	i can’t see the point in taking it’s screwing up my sleep &amp; i’m pretty sure it’s not helping with the depression.
1	morphine makes me mean!!!! and i'm on neurontin too i feel like a drugged up person lol
1	y'all this nuvaring is making me so tired &amp; spacey. i don't know if i can do this.
1	diclofenac gives me a serious heart burn.
1	nope, was on yrs &amp; had to get off due to unrelenting flare. been on since dec .
1	pregabalin has made me twitch and have little muscle spasms, it has reduced pain but i think my twitch is drawing attention
1	mad adderall = no sleep
1	gonna have to speak with my psychiatrist about stopping my olanzapine its interfering with my visions and it gives you memory loss and more.
1	ooh me too! rt : did not suit me at all. had severe tremors and weight gain.
1	wondered why my limbs ached and i was shivering on the hottest day of the year so far. forgot my venlafaxine. that'll be withdrawal then!
1	you are so horny and i am not! wtf!!! paxil why paxil why!!!!
1	i take fluoxetine and it doesn't do shit it just makes me dizzy and tired
1	i was on metoprolol but stopped it cos made fatigue even worse. am learning to just live with it
1	fanapt was the only thing that calmed her rages but comes with tremors. i'm so sorry
1	cause ucd sayed i had huntington's disease for like yrs, then said high dose zyprexa caused a false diagnosis. i think i have
1	if you're taking vyvanse can we please discuss side effects real quick wtf is happening to my digestive system
1	. giving percocet to treat vicodin withdrawal is good example of the need for easier md access to buprenorphine
1	/25/09 cdc response i contracted h1n1 days prior ,prescribed tamiflu wife i grieving her death on this day.u lie di-fi
1	narcotic, benzo, etc rx's arent the only meds addictive. if i miss a dose of wellbutrin or effer, my hands shake crazy &amp; i get brain zaps
1	didnt know lamotrigine was addictive stopped as didnt think were helping days of hell before realized, back on now
1	a lot of the time coming off adderall makes me feel like i have done molly a day or two ago.
1	i do not like how the gabapentin makes me so sleepy ! i wish it would not do that to me. ..grrrr
1	is anyone else out there on latuda and have trouble sleeping?
1	snort seroquel, black out.. woo!!
1	had to stop tysabri due to pml (i think that's what it was called) risk. new med coming in feb without risk factor
1	holy shit my spacer seriously amps up albuterol like i am shaking
1	enbrel causes weird dreams. dreamed i was hanging out with a group of young gay men who were obsessed with obtaining perfect dark skin +
1	cymbalta is especially weird i’ve had withdrawal quickly from missing a pill
1	when i forgot seroquel made me feel fucking ill as fuck!
1	maybe cos of the insulin blocking effect of seroquel but i do feel sugar crashes when eat fast carbs. will feel ill. so avoid where poss.
1	nexium got my stomach all types of fucked up dawg
1	time to get off paxil. it's really really been terrifying lately.
1	so anyway last night.. my new medication (venlafaxine/effer) made me feel the most depressed ever, and i overreacted about everything
1	does everyone remember the vioxx story? l monier demonstrating how vioxx link to heart attacks could've been found in data
1	lmao, i'm prescribed baby. it's for my anxiety. i take seroquel, and celexa with it. i'm a fucking zombie after pm.
1	never let anyone trick you into taking any form of buprenorphine unless you are suffering from opiate addiction. t is really hard to get off
1	olanzapine actually makes you put on weight, even when you aren't eating that much
1	so true ricky! i went into anaphylactic shock &amp; almost died from taking cipro! dangerous drug - be careful!! take care.
1	my missus took diclofenac when she slipped a disc. turned her into gollum overnight
1	he said usually ppl taper off effer, bc it’s a rough one to stop, but since i was starting viibryd i should be ok.
1	i'm having the worst withdrawals from my paroxetine. is this real life?
1	side effects of 'paxil rose' include slash rash and some izzy-ness upon standing.
1	i'm with you. even though the pristiq works, i still don't feel fully human.
1	trazodone is what he gave me while ago. that shit had me all tore up. i didn't like that shit haha.
1	allergic reaction to . feel free to share &amp; distribute. kill before it kills us.
1	effer was a boner killer, absolutely. welbutrin goes the other way.
1	my husband gives me my humira injections. we use the pens. it hurts too bad to give them to myself.
1	thank you, prozac, for my most fucked dream to date
1	negative. rimonabant does not cause reverse effects of marajuana, instead it causes extreme depression, anxiety, joint pains etc
1	what! nightmare made me jump awake! not nice at all. thought was supposed to keep me asleep through the night
1	lamotrigine also causes me to have fewer hours sleep a night
1	bloody dreadful nights sleep= joint pain. combination of sitting all day in training and full therapeutic dose of lamotrigine
1	yeah, that was a great fucking year. that's when paxil entered my life, and made it worse. years time sure helps, though.
1	to be honest i've had worse. on fluoxetine i was convinced there was a plot to steal my thoughts... !
1	coming off lamotrigine has been as bad as going up on it. poorly tummy, tiredness, feeling disconnected
1	wow adderall makes me such a tweak .... aka everyone should stay ft away from me today
1	called lamictal (for anxiety) that turns out i'm allergic to also. kicker is, they both can cause sjs. i never had a chance.
1	this metformin is giving me the worst period cramps in my whole life!
1	it helped me enormously with seroquel withdrawal but it makes benzo withdrawal much worse.
1	and with seroquel i take half of a mg pill. and it knocks me out; i can sleep for straight hours
1	awake, awake...the lunesta should have worn off by now
1	seriously if you are getting off cymbalta tape alot if movies i was up till and feel and look like a zombie just to tired to growl !!!

1	vimpat makes me exhaugsted!!
1	...my old ones! plus caffeine in the morning counteracts these quite nicely whereas quetiapine hangovers were unshiftable
1	had quit job: tendons in lots of pain, almost ruptured, hands barely usable now. damned cipro.
1	quetiapine side affects are increased appetite and cravings. it all makes sense.
1	seroquel gives me nightmares every fucking night but i take it anyway

1	nicotine is literally poison. but sometimes you gotta find out the hard way.

1	ventolin is not working its magic anymore ️️
1	ugh, lunesta has the worst aftertaste ever. forgot to use my peppermint oil tonight. =.(
1	i've got no motivation for things today. guess my amount of lunesta i took is still in my system.
1	hate that i've been off for ages now and my appetite is still terrible. the worst part? i can't bear meat or chocolate :'(
1	"fda needs a warning label on vyvanse: ""consumption of this drug may result in major ocd/many unneeded hrs at work"""
1	at the end of most working days! i still have to nap loads just to get through a week. some days better than others
1	neurontin helps my pain so much but basically puts me in a coma, of course. can't win
1	(cont'd) my pdoc altered the dosage of to mg. that's the only alteration. because i complained about the extreme fatigue.
1	reppin zoloft&amperoquel since last november. i'm hella gainin weight too awesome i'm fat and can't cum i own
1	i get it! enbrel will cure your joint pain by killing you with side effects. enough with the fine print.
1	hubs made me take olanzapine last night. feel rubbish this morning. really down. think i'm relapsing. work is definitely the trigger
1	"that's what u used to take that has wt loss as a side ""benefit"". tell ur dr fuck abilify, i want me some lamictal."
1	why does lunesta ruin everything i eat or drink tastewise?
1	half of seroquel knocks me out so fast and im asleep for at least hours...
1	my enbrel likes to marvin gaye. i think that is fart. i just went to the diarrhea hut and babysat some dentists.
1	going through a real bad nicotine withdraw...
1	fosamax and osteonecrosis of the jaw
1	my friends are annoying me and i'm having withdrawls from the paxil because american healthcare is a joke
1	well played tysabri...kicking butt .
1	the placebo week of birth control increases blood levels of lamictal, which in turn makes me a very cheerful insomniac.
1	i tried humira didn't work for my crohn's, infliximab has been a god send, also helps my ankylosing spondylitis
1	whilst palpitating thanks to ventolin
1	lowkey high af in class off these oxycodone
1	oxycodone screws with your stomach and makes you feverish haha whoooooo i don't feel great
1	metformin is the worst medication ever. makes your mouth taste like iron
1	half awake and po'd! mg of baclofen and mg of valium.... legs still spasmed too much to get tatted. i hatechyu legs!
1	little did i know that i would go through withdrawals when coming off of effer xr.
1	soooo i wore gray yogas &amp;took an adderall &amp;left my book bag at home. so what if my ass sweats. now what's gonna hide it?? shoulda wore black
1	deciding against taking adderall today because i think i want subway later.
1	*gets addicted to metformin (it gives u the poops)*
1	my memory is still so awful, hate the side effects of the pregabalin -.-
1	too much ventolin head feels all funny
1	im diabetic - i was on metformin since and had this yr b taken off it harmed my kidneys. i am on meds for diabetes now only diet.
1	for anxiety to penetrate through my drowsy haze (a result of the triumvirate of fluoxetine, pregabalin, amoxicillin?) is pretty good going.
1	oh god never do a ventolin right before bed
1	my dreams became vivider i think with effer
1	recommendations for drug abuse to subone
1	rt : i miss the days when i take mg seroquel with a bottle of wine and wake up standing in the kitchen naked, i literally mi…
1	i'm always irritated on vyvanse because people can't think as fast as i can. it's like every conversation is with someone at a nursing home
1	feeling a bit light-headed after ventolin but i'm breathing like i'm supposed to for the first time in like years..feels great
1	so, results of today's scope are pretty abysmal. humira not doing a bloody thing. dr. wants me on remicade asap. i hate this disease.
1	this lyrica stuff just makes me want to eat and sleep!
1	since enbrel helped relive my joint pain , my hearings gone , i can't feel my legs ,have eyes, an xtra kid ,but i can still play golf .
1	i know. i just realised with everything else - i haven't taken the sodding quetiapine yet!! wondered why i wasn't drowsy doh!
1	i am so damn sleepy today. i wonder if this is the avodart kicking in and getting rid of the last of the dht...

1	im having paroxetine withdrawals but thats ok cuz i still aint takin no moe fuck behavioral health ill be iight
1	meds work differently for each person. i know seroquel xr was hell for me &amp; i gained weight but can be heaven for another
1	i was on that before i started enbrel &amp; methotrexate. it didn't really help my arthritis but hopefully it helps you out
1	hey is not going to cover stelara anymore. humira and enbrel don't work for me. what can i do? any help?
1	oh man! i've been a total quetiapine zombie all morning! i've been taking them for years but every now + then they really mess me up!
1	taking it for depression mainly but i'm skipping an extra dose each week, i'm on viibryd . yeah cymbalta made me dizzy
1	olanzapine is amazing srsly, the dreams are immense, no addiction, its gorgeous, like brave new world soma to me
1	saying that, the whole reason i gained weight in the first place was due to the drug olanzapine. doctor's fault. ah well.
1	some inhalers make you shaky and can increase the feeling of anxiety. my flovent tastes like rocks.
1	every time i forget seroquel, i end up rage breaking things eg- my laptop *facepalm*
1	i had itchy skin at night on venlafaxine, i react badly to insect bites too.
1	yesh. i tried lunesta and ambien. ambien was a joke. lunesta made my mouth taste like battery acid
1	cymbalta withdrawal &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
1	that day you don’t take spiriva until noon, which is body clock pm. no wonder i felt tight. hi, prednisone, too. jeepers.
1	i think the lunesta is interacting with the vyvanse because i am definitely drilling a mint
1	up all night in complete agony with pain. ended up double dosing on gabapentin and naproxen, and now feel like i'm floating!!
1	girl my doc raised my dosage for metformin and i have been so sick all damn day! i feel your pain
1	recently it's really hurt when i use my enbrel epipen: those seconds seem to last for ever. any suggestions about what might help?
1	i'm on rabeprazole sodium and if i eat a bowl of cereal i'm full for the rest of the day.
1	tecfidera takers: anyone get their dosage reduced due to low wbc count? this may happen for me, and it makes me a little worried.
1	it's am and still no sleep fuck you vyvanse
1	fluticasone propionate was a bad idea. joint pain all week. happened to my mom, too. it was working, though.
1	all i have done today is sleep. and i still need to sleep more. this is a welcome change.
1	out of pills, feeling like a train wreck
1	well i didn't gain kg in hrs. seroquel gained it for me over months. ffffffffffuuuuuuu
1	doc gave me ventolin this round because it's $20 cheaper than my proventil but it doesn't work as well for me &gt;.&lt;
1	humira didn't work for me but the remicade (infleximaub) was awesome. good luck. i did great!
1	chest pain. enex has me jittery. &amp; ishould be asleep.
1	addicted to nicotine badly.
1	also tripped balls off tamiflu actually seeing and hearing shit when i woke up apparently it's common in children so i am a child
1	oxycodone just makes me ears rumble and does like nothing else
1	so my body was goin threw withdrawl? lol didnt kno paxil was that strong lol
1	upped my effer dosage days ago. sleep cycle and quality went to shit days ago. i sense a correlation here...
1	just woke up from a hour nap thank u fluoxetine
1	aubagio - been on it for days; have eerienced hand/feet peeling (very dry skin).
1	i think advair makes my skin dry
1	this paxil makes me pee so often omg
1	did you know insanely intense dreams are a known side effect of venlafaxine? it's not an antidepressant, it's my dream fuel!
1	depakote made me feel flat, but helps many. zyprexa can cause weight gain, so be very careful. i can't tolerate it.
1	does anyone know if the gain is less in combined with () than in olanzapine alone?
1	i'm high off this tamiflu rn i'm telling you
1	i have a penicillin/ keflex allergy so my dr writes me days of zpack or i'd still be sick too! sometimes cipro
1	i will but the flow vent and advair helps so much they make you so shaky.
1	best of luck man! and they do suck :/ i was on olanzapine (abilify didnt work)...was awful, gained stone. off it nw n doin gud!
1	one of the most common side effects with metformin is gi complaints – in most cases, start low and titrate up slowly
1	lamictal and trileptal and seroquel...of course the seroquel i take in severe situations because gaining weight is never cool
1	this night of no sleep is brought to you by vyvanse.
1	word. i've been fuckin tweakin out on vyvanse and writing hella verses
1	hi chris, try diclofenac ,30mg, times daily, best anti-inflammatory gives great pain relief, but you need to take omeprazole
1	i had to taper myself down. i think the seroquel gave me lasting sleep paralysis. i've had it ever since.
1	olanzapine is another anti-psychotic medication. it works on my bipolar but makes me binge eat
1	?oh god never do a ventolin right before bed
1	coming off the lamotrigine. it's not acceptable to be in pain most of the time. struggled to get out of the bath on sat
1	finally got my vyvanse today, now i can go back to hating food . ha
1	jesus christ those symptoms of serious side effects for whatever the hell crestor is are the symptoms of pancreatic cancer.
1	have to go to a doc now to see why i'm still gaining. stupid paxil made me gain like pounds and now i have to lose it
1	i lost weight in the past but it was much easier. like steps forward, one step back on the quetiapine.
1	lunesta has the most disgusting after taste what the fuck, am i eating pennies jfc
1	allergic to morphine, codeine &amp; tramadol. was okay on buprenorphine tablets but had to come off as block anaesthetic.
1	5 day rivaroxaban diary. lower back ache, neck ache, hips and knees ache, short of breath, (am asthmatic) taken paracetamol, to bed.
1	&amp; i'm about to be sick af tomorrow because i ran out of paxil
1	withdrawal has reached a peak, lost vision and almost crashed my car from a brain zap. thanks a zillion
1	i have to work tomorrow. why the eff am i still awake? oh right, stupid ventolin making my lungs work but my heart rate go weird.
1	uncontrollable tremors in hands and legs. body would rock all the time. restlessness. desperation.
1	i am way too hyper to go home and do nothing tonight damn prozac &gt;.&lt;
1	humira was the last drug i tried, did absolutely nothing. doctors have no faith that remicade will be my solution, but i have to try?!
1	so i just put my nuvaring in. we'll see how this goes... stomach is feeling a little weird right now.
1	about to take mg of temazepam aka bezos and see how long i can stay awake should be fun
1	put miralax in my coffee today so i could spend an easy min in the bathroom ducking the office but nothing is happening
1	rt : what i lack in money and personality, i make up for in paxil induced impotency
1	what was it like? i have teriflunomide mg tablet, called aubagio. my hair falls off. i have been eating this months.
1	stomach discomfort, flushed, sweating, weird jaw, this stuff sucks
1	they are on to you. poppin' metoprolol and she sweatin'.
1	two hours at the doctors just for them to give me zoloft and dexilant (an acid reflux medication that gave me ulcers) -___-
1	5 day rivaroxaban diary strange muscle spasms especially in neck shoulders and legs. no more fluid retention. more mobile.
1	but i'm happy to be clean. just really really really really really really really sucked going from mg desvenlafaxine / day to zero.
1	medicines like tamoxifen and raloxifene are used to treat but can increase .
1	my step-dad was on effexer,taking supplements for energy and drinking like a fish when he shot my daughter&amp;me
1	can't sleep. lunesta sucks.
1	not even taking my adderall is helping me concentrate on my career counseling reading.
1	nope, i tested positive for jcv. jcv &amp; tysabri = permanent brain damage or sudden death.
1	januvia could make you hungry though. and irritable. hangry.
1	oh i get it ambien + seroquel now i'm floatin
1	so, i lasted days on seroquel. i couldn't handle the awful side effects. constantly dizzy and lightheadeded &amp; a myriad of other bad stuff
1	id suggest pregabalin instead... and even then i had to split it into smaller doses because my vision went odd at mg tabs
1	yup ,yup !!! one more thing ask her to watch her diet.......olanzapine can cause weight gain !
1	i still get the pins &amp; needles feeling in my hands since doing humira
1	okay i took the seroquel and i am resisting the urge to vomit it up i feel disgusting but oh well good times good vibes don't be sad
1	just got prescribed to oxycodone and i can't feel a damn thing
1	...face. and quetiapine slightly increases sun sensitivity too.
1	i feel like the kids from 'a nightmare on elm street' i need sleep. the lunesta shit doesn't work for me. can i have ambien again?
1	the bcbs ppl and drug co vioxx gave obgyn give women pain ! omgod almost killed me !
1	you r right cipro nearly killed me
1	prozac makes me want to destroy myself. js.
1	reducing the lamotrigine is grim. exhausted and grumpy. got another weeks of this yet. wondering if i'm doing the right thing?
1	when i was on cymbalta and visanne i could not orgasm at all!!!
1	took my enbrel yesterday so of course i broke fever today. of fucking course. is it even worth it? :/
1	cymbalta, my mood has worsened
1	eat my trazodone then go to bed, wake up in the morning with holes in my head
1	since quetiapine's messed with my prolactin levels, making my boobs humungous &amp; my bras so eensive, i want a lingerie component to dla.
1	trying to keep up with a football game is very difficult under the influence of oxycodone
1	quetiapine made me eat all the sweets, the sour ones seem to help with the dry mouth
1	"seroquel census: ""did we kiss?"" (notes i scribble next to my bed at am, loopy on anti-psychotics)"
1	&lt; i was on lamictal for a while (for other reasons) but i had to stop due to an allergic reaction.
1	ugh i'm gonna puke, too much adderall in my system
1	was on keppra came off them as they stopped me feeling hungry and i lost to much weight i'm now on vimpat
1	it was th period when i was still fucked up off them vicodins &amp; seroquel. i remember it was lunch &amp; i left because something pissed me off.
1	wow. venlafaxine and mirtazapine must be very sedative. i’ve had them before separately n was knocked out-ishx
1	suffice to say i am not particularly a fan of quetiapine sponsored dreams
1	my vision is blurred rn from tbis oxycodone
1	venlafaxine definitely does mine. also makes me need hours sleep a day. hence now unmediated &amp; rollercoastery.
1	i'm in so much pain now... tendonitis, headaches, cognitive issues... i feel violated.
1	been off synthroid and metformin for a week. i no longer have aches/pains in my shoulders or legs. stopping victoza, going on insulin only.
1	damn you seroquel! why you only let me sleep four hours!?!?
1	my sim card isn't working aaggh i feel like im having cymbalta withdrawal again aaagh aaaggh
1	i hope you're better soon! i'm sorry the tamiflu didn't work, but glad it didn't do anything weird! i had bad side effects.
1	that lyrica works!! but it scares me that i can't feel anything good or bad! i stopped taking it. i take cymbalta and celebrex
1	tamiflu makes me so very nauseated.
1	you want bad withdrawl, effer had that..evil stuff for me...never again. i strongly believe it caused some memory damage for me.
1	have been on humira years now n get on off chest infections that sometimes need diff pills sort out should i b worried?
1	developing add in my s thanks to the memory/attention-killing lamictal i've been on since my early teens.
1	i think i finally feel the last of the toxins slithering loudly out of my body. dr's shouldn't prescribe medicine that does this.
1	i've had a lovely, relaxing day, but end it weighed down by nonspecific foreboding and crushing sense of guilt
1	the zantac quit working so i added nexium &amp; that seems to help but i have to take both twice a day.
1	olanzapine made me gain lbs in a few months, plus it gave me bad acne breakouts. had to beg my old shrink to take me off it
1	i've heard of all kinds of skin issues on lamictal! pretty sure mine is psychosomatic though...
1	this damn symbicort commercial said the side effect is death and they said it out loud wtf.....

1	feeling better and much less anxious (i could actually talk to people yesterday) but the fluoxetine makes me sooooo sleepy...
1	i seem to need to sleep right now. quetiapine takers, is this normal?
1	yeah, i'm ok. that was weird. might've been meds. got a new batch yesterday. i'm remembering the effer xr making me sick once.
1	round trazodone. please just put me to sleep, not make me into a zombie the whole next day.
1	rimonabant :-anti obesity drug withdrawn due to bad side effects !
1	had my weekly etanercept last night. working better for me than methotrexate did
1	so far so good. i was on remicade for years then had a bad reaction. just started humira
1	ugh, maybe tamiflu isn't the greatest thing after all. it can cause insomnia and anxiety.
1	my husband gerald wunsch has neuropathy from velcade and is now on kyprolis in a maintenance therapy day ,2,15,16
1	subone got me fucked up.
1	all nighter is killing me right now, i hate you vyvanse

1	humira why you burn my veins
1	the seroquel the doc gave me, makes doing things difficult. . . but if i don't do something, i'll fall asleep. the catch-22 of crazy.
1	found out that it could be two months before i sleep well again now that i'm off seroquel. srsly, fuck the psychiatrist that put me on it.
1	after enbrel quit working i tried humira, then remicade and orencia infusions and none worked next is cimzia
1	in other news, i've got my first weird side effect from quetiapine. numbness and tingling in my fingertips.
1	not that i ever noticed. i was taking it with venlafaxine, and it definitely made me drowsy
1	subone withdrawal is so much fun
1	do i look brave enough to refuse medication that has side effects i don't want? i have before. symbicort causes osteoporosis.
1	i took tamiflu and since then i've eerienced skin allergic reactions throughout my body and haven't felt the same. is it safe?
1	losing it. could not remember the word power strip. wonder which drug is doing this memory lapse thing. my guess the cymbalta.

1	trazadone be having me aded . lunesta didnt work for my insomnia.
1	well, i'm now convinced humira &amp; enbrel were the culprits of my weight gain! other tnf will likely result in same. now what?
1	many congratualtions for being able to come off quetiapine - i have read that and clozapine are the worst for withdrawals
1	yeah when i take vyvanse any food just looks/sounds/tastes fucking disgusting
1	anybody know anything about side effects of venlafaxine? come off 'em wks ago, still feeling awful. physical withdrawal awful
1	thanks! yes, after i was prescribed cipro a few years ago, and it really messed me up, i am quite wary of broad spectrum ones.
1	i can't tolerate it either, same for codeine and all its other cousins. darvocet is where it's at.
1	rt : since quetiapine's messed with my prolactin levels, making my boobs humungous &amp; my bras so eensive, i want a lingerie…
1	seriously, when i get a man i'm gonna have to take my nuvaring out, i never even think about sex but with the pills

1	i am so tired right now. like i feel like i used to when i used to take seroquel and lithium. i haven't been this tired naturally ever
1	may have been the mix of diclofenac &amp; aspirin. heart started to beat fast, after focus wore off.
1	and now i can feel the seroquel melting my brain, so it's time to sleep. may my dreams be filled with visions of mechanical sex.
1	i can't wait to go get my anti nauaea meds tonight. i feel like shit. humira is definitely kicking my ass but my skin lools great.
1	sometimes it never ends. so sorry. topomax is miserable with parasthesia, cognitive problems, kidney stones. lamictal's good
1	binge watching upstairs downstairs on netflix. hurrah for enbrel and it's power to lift ridiculous fatigue!
1	have been in a lot of pain all day though and i feel and look like a zombie. seroquel is quite an annoying medication, ugh. -.-
1	you can see why i need a break! it's the pregabalin or as i prefer to call it, pre-babbling.
1	asians are at higher risk for severe allergic skin reactions to carbamazepine. phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and lamotrigine are alternatives.
1	i hate to be all anecdotal evidence-y but i was assured taking enbrel wouldn't make me get sick more. i got a cold day after my nd dose.
1	i take olanzapine and have a permanent dry mouth what can i do to help it
1	i once took lunesta and i drove in my sleep. woke up in a walmart parking lot counties over.

1	great.. i have hives up and down my legs from this gosh dang trazodone
1	you don't know insomnia until you take seroquel and work out at am.
