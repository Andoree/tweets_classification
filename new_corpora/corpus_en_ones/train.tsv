1	fluoxetine, got me going crazy.
1	i take mg of lamictal everyday i'm tired leave me alone
1	alendronate is an important cause of pill esophagitis, in osteoporosis give raloxifene instead.

1	humira didn't work for me but the remicade (infleximaub) was awesome. good luck. i did great!

1	taking mg of saphris last night was the most monumentally stupid idea ever. i didn't sleep until 0am and the day is a write off
1	i get my headaches when my humira wears off. my dad is on remicade.
1	i know of a lot of people on flovent for ee. my yr old uses pulmicort. biggest debate: meds or food elimination?
1	i was on humira a while back and worked ok bit then stopped being so effective. infliximab on the other hand is amazing for..
1	why is it that people take gabapentin for recreational use. dose increase is making me hyperactive. will have clean house but broken body!

1	vimpat gives me crazy double vision, too. that reminds me... medicine time!
1	fuck here comes the nicotine cravings damn you hookah
1	glad that worked. humira made me sick, remicade stopped working, nothing works. cimzia on now, but not working well either
1	i've been taking venlafaxine since , it's like hotel california - you can check in, but you can never leave.
1	so i just put my nuvaring in. we'll see how this goes... stomach is feeling a little weird right now.
1	took this oxycodone on an empty stomach lmaoooo i'm so fucking high

1	day cold turkey from effer. i believe this pic adequately represents my descent into madness. or whatever.
1	i've had ten tysabri infusions and i feel sick each and every time i get them for a few days up to a week. is this my life now?
1	herxing is like being a giant ball of pain and insomnia. advil, painkillers, imitrex, and lunesta don't touch it.
1	remicade worked great for me for years! then i developed antibodies to it. i've been on enbrel and simponi since-now orencia.
1	i had panic and aniexty orders a few years ago before i took paxil but i never freaked out on ppl and cried hysterically
1	viibryd gives me occasional lucid dreams, as well as epic photorealistic dreams with elaborate interweaving plots.
1	i took about milagrams of miralax and still havent pooped....wtf (i have a colonoscopy tomorrow)
1	my mood swings are getting worse and lamotrigine isn't helping at all.…
1	i took victoza and the sick feeling does ease and stop. i found taking in evening helped.
1	found out that it could be two months before i sleep well again now that i'm off seroquel. srsly, fuck the psychiatrist that put me on it.
1	didnt take my fluoxetine this morning because i forgot and i've been so shaky and tired all day, is this like, withdrawal symptoms?
1	i don't know that one, but metho made me sick everyday i took it. i had to stop. enbrel has worked wonders for me .. so far
1	this adderall finna have me cleaning everything.
1	ugh, sorry. this effer is not making me feel so awesome. posting puck's stuff tonight though.
1	i only took basic of gabapentin this morning. was so confused i locked hubby out then collapsed.he thought i was drunk or od'd on something
1	my hands &amp; legs are holding a hate campaign against me. i can see us falling out if they don't sort themselves out
1	this oxycodone finna knock me out ..
1	i hate quetiapine. i was so relieved to come off it and stop feeling like a zombie.
1	my body is so not ready for this seroquel. never had an antidepressant knock me the fuck out at a quarter dose before o _o
1	my ventolin inhaler never works
1	slept. ate. did yoga. lamictal + latuda = pain? any comments/opinions?
1	fluoxetine and quet combo zombified me...ah, the meds merrygoround
1	pregabalin gives me d-cinema vision (without the glasses) - it's unusual seeing the rgb spectrum distort whatever you're looking at.
1	are these thoughts my own.... this is your brain on shafer subone twitter fueled freakout
1	i tried that going cold turkey on venlafaxine and depakote is not a good idea i dreamt colours and lost my fucking mind aghh!
1	adderall makes me vomit and vyvanse gives me migraines.. the struggle
1	i can't take this i thought having seroquel would make it easier but nope. my whole body feels like i have raw nerve endings going crazy
1	i appreciate it. i gained over lbs with paxil so i'm trying something different, tired of the appetite side effects.
1	i have suffered severe reaction to infliximab after th one so had to stop. humira is next step in uk
1	i should share that i'm deathly allergic to nalane, &amp;long-term buprenorphine was horrific to detox, took weeks. caution.
1	...these horrors are on info sheet in box!! lyrica elains weight gain &amp; cym elains so much more. why don't they tell us? dammit
1	ugh i'm trying to figure out how i got infectious colitis... the flagyl and levaquin have knocked me on my butt
1	but they had to take me off geodon cuz i was developing tardive dyskonesia
1	woke up from a nap with a really bad headache, my nd headache in three days.
1	also told me i was imagining agitation from lyrica because she hasn't heard anyone say it.it's common effect
1	pregabalin has made me twitch and have little muscle spasms, it has reduced pain but i think my twitch is drawing attention
1	rt : my medication gives me weird &amp; bizarre dreams. not all bad though. last night i had dinner with the rolling stones …
1	ventolin suck out all my energy.
1	holy shit balls pristiq withdrawals are very strong!
1	not sure the paxil is working any more
1	i had to take paroxetine tablets for a year nd a side effect is weight gain, it went to my core. off them now bt can't shift it!
1	pretty sure my vyvanse is making me dizzy and making my chest hurt.
1	enbrel for sure gives me wings! and i can't eat! it's great!!
1	many congratualtions for being able to come off quetiapine - i have read that and clozapine are the worst for withdrawals
1	me: why have i been sectioned, what psychotic symptoms do i have? psychiatrist: dancing. i am now addicted to the antipsychotic olanzapine
1	on cimzia and prednisone. was on remicade, then humira both did not work for me. cimzia seems to for now. have ileostomy + yrs
1	hi the side effects can be really bad ive been through lots.i am ok thanks ive only just started pregabalin bit numb though
1	well my effer kinda did its job to keep my anxiety under control.... but now to get my heart rate down..... ugh
1	fibro flares floor me so i can empathise with you on that. doc put me on lyrica mths ago n iv put st on n lost my memory.
1	do you think ms or tysabri effects teeth. the enamel or you get more toothaches ?
1	throbbing headache from not having my pills. pills left i need to save. this sucks
1	i eat my trazodone and go to bed; wake up in the morning with holes in my head
1	ssri discontinuation syndrome is a bitch. effer, i hate you. wellbutrin, thanks for being nice to me. now do your job kthx.
1	same lol didn't eat a thing, damn vyvanse
1	i couldn't take lamictal week into it i got the rash.a rush trip to the er.6 months till rash was gone.
1	so far so good. i was on remicade for years then had a bad reaction. just started humira
1	trying to distract with masterchef, twitter, texting &amp; candy crush but i’m anxious &amp; have stomach &amp; head pain
1	- whilst i was maxed on tegretol, neurontin &amp; lyrica for pain management, my memory and decision-making ability were all shot
1	no pain is worse than humira. not even arthritis. lmfao.
1	take a strattera they say. it's like adderall they say. and then i was trying to figure out why i felt like dying all day
1	you may be right that hpv is found in cc. my point is your shot may cause serious harm. like vioxx caused to many.
1	hours sleep and still i feel tired and dizzy
1	new meds have me out of it. i want therapy not doping up! i was highly functioning now have trouble standing!
1	i fucking hate advair but it might be what i get put on. the albuterol isn't good for my heart or blood pressure long term.
1	i'm becoming too tolerant to vyvanse
1	nicotine lozenges. if i go cold turkey i can’t think (or see) straight, so i can’t work.
1	achilles tendon rupture is a side effect of fluoroquinolones stay away from cipro!!!!
1	thanks! yes, after i was prescribed cipro a few years ago, and it really messed me up, i am quite wary of broad spectrum ones.
1	i've been giving her fiber tablets daily for days and before that miralax but miralax makes her puke. i'm just gonna die
1	that is surely possible but sometimes the tamiflu does not work
1	ventolin was pretty harsh, i remember that racing heart feeling.
1	i felt drugged on ritalin. i love vyvanse. i can't tell i'm on it except for feeling better and calmer and more structured
1	i think baclofen might make me a bigger asshole than usual. :/
1	i was on venlafaxine after the citalopram but it messed up my sleep
1	my dreams became vivider i think with effer
1	i'm feeling weirdly antsy lately and i'm positive it's due to the prozac and i'm a bit worried where that could lead me
1	i just found out that some dude from my friend's family was in a coma because of that drug (zyprexa) i was prescribed.
1	//pardon the upcoming loopy tweets. taking some oxycodone soon for the pain.
1	i've taken the bp daily if not twice a day like i should, it's juz i didn't think the effer would spike it so. i'm usually
1	vyvanse fucks me up man, no way in hell i can do that one. never taken focalin tho
1	it works otherwise. my pcp started me on trazodone before. i felt like i.had a frontal lobotomy the following day
1	oh hey. much like other anti-convulsants, lamictal dehydrates you. so much is elained.
1	today is the day for my biweekly humira injection, any volunteers to take it for me? it hurts.
1	fingers crossed i have been taken off tysabri because my body is resisting it ha typical hope you are doing ok
1	ooooop. anyone know if amoxicillin and pregabalin have an interaction? never had one with fluoxetine and losartan... so dizzy!
1	i don't know what that has to do w/ me. avelox has hurt my connective tissue,lungs and thyroid. i guess i should feel lucky
1	coming off effer was the worst ever. even my doctor was terrified of me doing it but the side effects left me no choice.
1	i hate cipro!
1	i ate cakes + pastries at work today. blaming the quetiapine rather than my liking for cakes. blaming work too for providing free cake.
1	took baclofen mg &amp; ibuprofen mg &amp; now i'm laying flat on my back.
1	i feel like the kids from 'a nightmare on elm street' i need sleep. the lunesta shit doesn't work for me. can i have ambien again?
1	im on an adderall high atm and im shaking and my heart is pounding fuck
1	": then again. i haven't slept in hours so that probably has a little something to do with it" adderall got him like
1	probably the combination with my fluoxetine. but i can't move that to night time, it makes me have bad dreams.
1	i can only get about -8 hours of sleep on my own. but i got at least hours with seroquel. i now see how people can get addicted.
1	my husband gerald wunsch has neuropathy from velcade and is now on kyprolis in a maintenance therapy day ,2,15,16
1	lyrica may cause suicidal thoughts or actions. my mom thinks they are on point there.
1	my step-dad was on effexer,taking supplements for energy and drinking like a fish when he shot my daughter&amp;me
1	playing league while on vyvanse is too damn stressful. back to public i go!
1	you want bad withdrawl, effer had that..evil stuff for me...never again. i strongly believe it caused some memory damage for me.
1	they've got him on fucking subone but he's acting like he's on coke
1	i tried ambieb, lunesta and restoril, none work. my ex used to get so messed up when he took ambien but it doesn't affect me.
1	lls it's cool. u could try lunesta but that shit leaves a bad after taste. you'll wake up inna morning with it and everythin
1	thanks saphris now i'm pounds fatter and counting. fuck meds
1	as effective as enbrel is on my i really could do without the second-day hangover.
1	omg i just an enbrel commercial. no don't take it. i take a shot ever friday it make you weak af and your immune system goes down the drain.
1	i cannot be in the sun!
1	im tweaking off adderall today and i feel like im dying
1	i've taken gabapentin and vicodin. don't eect me to make any sense.
1	i had sleep paralysis every night for four months when i took quetiapine in addition to lamotrigine
1	oxycodone put me to sleep this whole week
1	i will but the flow vent and advair helps so much they make you so shaky.
1	lmao. i loved geodon until i started passing out in public and losing chunks of my day. it was good when it was good, though.
1	being white doesnt help with this subone withdrawal. some forces of nature are too strong and dont discriminate.
1	god i'd like to go to sleep right now. but i'm still a little afraid of the visions, even though i stopped taking viibryd days ago.
1	a lot of the time coming off adderall makes me feel like i have done molly a day or two ago.
1	raptiva - caution ! this drug has been recalled due to causing chronic diseases.
1	ugh i hate metformin im sick
1	i've been getting almost daily headaches for the past weeks side effects of ? i've been on it for months now though
1	i switched to humira in feb. i was on remicade for yrs. it worked wonders at first but my body stopped responding
1	sick of feeling tired. fed up of meds not working. loads to do today &amp; no freaking motivation or energy
1	wow, the rls is out of control tonight does anyone out there taking seroquel have issues with restless leg syndrome?
1	gave in wholeheartedly today to my olanzapine munchies. had already had an ice cream and milkshake before this :-0
1	i got the joint pain from remicade, humira made it worse &amp; gave me neuropathy in my feet &amp; my hair falling out like crazy
1	hopefully i would love to chat or talk by skype with you and your team. i am on med saphris. i lost pounds months ago.
1	saphris gives me a mad appetite omg i jate this
1	another light nights sleep brought to me courtesy of dammit.
1	only new med is the enex hfa for asthma. i'm wondering if there is a % hardly ever happens reaction that lowers heart rate?
1	mom on nexium (ppi) vr yrs fda caught co secret held ppi cause osteoporosis+ b defect my child has mad excuse
1	what meds are you on? gabapentin /pregablin =horrible weight gain. opiates can cause very bad nausea /stomach pains /vomiting...
1	reducing the lamotrigine is grim. exhausted and grumpy. got another weeks of this yet. wondering if i'm doing the right thing?
1	has anyone ever had to take avelox? i need some tricks to curb the nausea and help me with the hypotension.
1	anyway for the nausea in meantime sipped some plus and it is better. mightnt be gastric related then, just sympathetic response fr lyrica
1	i'm sorry to hear that. i had a side effect from humira that negated all tnf blockers so no enbrel for me either.
1	thank you! i have high hopes. was on enbrel + metotraxate before and stopped working
1	coming off lamotrigine has been as bad as going up on it. poorly tummy, tiredness, feeling disconnected
1	i can't tolerate it either, same for codeine and all its other cousins. darvocet is where it's at.
1	(triggering) so... i'm taking quetiapine and tramadol pre-cutting. i'm allergic to tramadol...this should be interesting
1	the zantac quit working so i added nexium &amp; that seems to help but i have to take both twice a day.
1	negative. rimonabant does not cause reverse effects of marajuana, instead it causes extreme depression, anxiety, joint pains etc
1	changed brand of metformin and back on the ones that make me fart like buggery.
1	eurgh! last time i was this tired, i was on a four day antidepressant cocktail binge.
1	cipro destroyed my entire body, from head to toe. bedridden since . be very careful.
1	no med orders til effer is fully exited. still having brain shivers, but mostly when i don't eat.
1	it scares me the thought of having to be medicated forever bc i go with pristiq for hours and i become so depressed and down, i hate it.
1	functioning when on pregabalin is next to impossible
1	also tripped balls off tamiflu actually seeing and hearing shit when i woke up apparently it's common in children so i am a child
1	bah . i remember! . paroxetine was what did that to me... and increased my symptoms ten-fold -_-.
1	prozac is the bartering stage. tell them it's not working. do not say "friends say duloxetine is like being on e hours a day".
1	liquid oxycodone got me feelin woozie!
1	me too. i always forget, nuvaring is irritating, no shots, no patches... implant makes you bleed all the time. ugh. lol
1	dopamine earrings adrenaline charm bracelet red pemoline eyes.
1	adderall. vyvanse gave me some pretty undesirable sexual side effects try and find focalin. it's new and well liked so far.
1	this subone got me feeling super sick, idk why i tried this malarkey
1	so now i'm on carvedilol mg per day, warfarin mg per day and dexlansoprazole mg per day. no wonder my body is slowly being ruined...
1	i hated effer. it makes you hungry, dizzy, and lethargic. that culminated in a large weight gain for me.
1	doesn't work. citilopram then fluoxetine before, bothe did nothing for my mood but made me vomit so much i lost stone in mo.
1	coming off mg venlafaxine over days was a better idea in discussion. my brain feels like its actually vibrating!
1	i've heard of all kinds of skin issues on lamictal! pretty sure mine is psychosomatic though...
1	man, i remember getting darvicet and that stuff made me so loopy i couldn't take it.
1	oh well this might be why the side effects from cold turkey quitting pristiq were so horrible. it is concentrated effer.
1	i'm a little worried. when i take oxycodone for pain, the high usually only lasts ~30 minutes tops. its been hours now.
1	getting real tired of ugly bumps on my thighs from enbrel injections
1	yeah girl i got a kidney stone so i'm taking oxycodone its knocking my ass out!
1	the albuterol making me sleepy
1	think i'm addicted to ventolin inhalers
1	lol! a colleague acquired mets after crestor and was shocked to learn how potatoes impact her blood sugar.
1	weeks sober today. have had cravings but no where near as intense as when i was on antipsychotic seroquel. convinced of connection.
1	sleeping my life away on . fine by me.
1	metformin only has gi upset issues mostly, other than that its quite safe, but i take it because i need it
1	upped my effer dosage days ago. sleep cycle and quality went to shit days ago. i sense a correlation here...
1	right now i'm getting by on a low dose of pred and the doc wants me to consider humira since remicade stopped working.
1	moms lunesta go me tweeeekin
1	i've got no motivation for things today. guess my amount of lunesta i took is still in my system.
1	popped a fluoxetine im sweating
1	ok well try your best. i'm on saphris but i can only take mg at most or get an anxiety attack.
1	last night video chatted me while i was in a lunesta haze. i couldn't see or hear her, but knew she was there. weird
1	i wish everyone i loved wasn't addicted to nicotine.
1	januvia could make you hungry though. and irritable. hangry.
1	a big ol' fuck you to my doctor for not telling me a side effect of metoprolol was depression. just wait until i see you friday -.-
1	tysabri helped with my flares but killed my immune system. haven't had side effects from aubagio ++++
1	had to file adverse reaction report on brilinta after heart stents. made my bg uncontrollable.
1	"a slimming coffee that could give serious side effects because it contains the active sibutramine substance"
1	so the geodon is what made me so frickin hungry all the time cause i've eaten very little these past few days.
1	i hated being on paxil for that reason. way to make you *more* depressed. x.x
1	okay, this metoprolol is not a game. aside from the occasional chest pain when i breathe, i'm fine.
1	up all night in complete agony with pain. ended up double dosing on gabapentin and naproxen, and now feel like i'm floating!!
1	i take fluoxetine and it doesn't do shit it just makes me dizzy and tired
1	ok found the culprit of the leg cramps its simvastatin and maybe atorvastatin
1	this lyrica stuff just makes me want to eat and sleep!
1	this subone is making me gain weight. i don't know why. but i don't like it. im still active so i don't get it
1	yeah, generic venlafaxine has about four different slow release formulations, i got withdrawals from some.
1	i've been on humira going on years now; was on enbrel previously - worked for a few yrs then lost some effectiveness
1	rt : i cannot be in the sun!
1	imma get my mothafuckin tubes tied asap. wondering why i gained lbs over the last months = been on nuvaring for the past months. duh.
1	this quetiapine isn't working damnit!!!! does make me hungry at night though... *sigh*
1	this damn symbicort commercial said the side effect is death and they said it out loud wtf.....
1	&lt;are high, i'm more tired!! so i'm doing myself no favours. trying to avoid taking metformin xxxx
1	life: fucked. mind: falling into a realm of utter disillusion. thank the lord for contributing to it.
1	off, and i did nuvaring and i had no period for months and i was so happy! but then i spotted for months straight and i was
1	hi the latuda was the worst for me. i felt constantly doped up, it made my muscles hurt so bad, i was a wreck.
1	neurontin was a few weeks of "omg i feel better i do all the things" then "why the fuck you stop helping?!?"
1	started with avonex yrs ago then tysabri. allergic so nothing for + yrs now tecfidera
1	fuck you trazodone. i didn't want or need to sleep for hours.
1	vyvanse sucks it gave me anxiety so i suggest you take strattera it's so much better acacia
1	i hated seroquel, i was sleeping hrs a day on it
1	i take qvar x a day. singulair gave me nightmares and advair made weird things grow out my skin, itching burning too :-/
1	i'm allergic to tramadol, codeine, buprenorphine and tapentadol yet my gp has prescribed me oxycodone. if i die this week ya'll know why
1	don't take viibryd i used to and it makes you really out of it :x
1	being sold as all natural but it has the drug sibutramine which was banned in by the fda for risk with stroke &amp; heart attack
1	let's talk about how i forgot what adderall felt like and now i'm on it again and i'm going nuts.
1	cough medicine with codeine + a breathing treatment + pro air + symbicort + steroids = no sleep. &amp; i still can't fucking breathe.
1	wondered why my limbs ached and i was shivering on the hottest day of the year so far. forgot my venlafaxine. that'll be withdrawal then!
1	fucking effer withdrawals. i would shake my fist but i don't have the energy.
1	enbrel fucking hurts
1	only problem is the ride has fuelled the olanzapine munchies. i was a nightmare in the supermarket tonight!
1	quetiapine perhaps gives most dramatic effect for single low dose. no, pts are not being lazy in bed hours a day, asleep!
1	": i'm feeling pretty good for only having one hour of sleep" adderall will do that to ya.
1	st heart attack was from a blood clot likely caused by anti-inflammatory vioxx taking for spinal probs.
1	. so what caused the surges in ? did any one wonder why? do you know that a surge in can cause a ?
1	getting ready to go to dr today to see if viibryd is causing nightmares, a1c and several other small things
1	well miralax didn't work for me. i think im invincible at this point.
1	i take way too much zoloft and seroquel to get the horn my life is a lie
1	off to the doctors to talk over what's next, seeing as how pregabalin does nothing apart from make me dizzy
1	i'm gonna get a good miles in ️ my tummy hurts though from my iron pills is have to take so i put some miralax in my coffee!
1	why i came off it. gp told me its not dangerous but it is damn unpleasant. at least i know it's the quetiapine that's causing it
1	hi i'm using enbrel too but it didn't work
1	just don't sleep since increase of my nexavar dose.
1	too tired to function right now, thanks humira.
1	god humira shots blow so bad...
1	partial complex on lamotrigine lacosamide zonisamide poor memory, trip over my tongue. anyone the same?
1	since vioxx killed my mother highly suggest persons who notice change in loved one, friend, anyone investigate adverse reactions.
1	rt : if this is a real question, withdrawal from an antidepressant named effer was worse than cocaine withdrawal
1	i went into anaphylactic shock while getting a remicade infusion. i've been on humira a few yrs now....
1	i only had very mild side effects from viibryd (a strange floaty feeling) for a couple of days, then nothing.
1	my battle continues with olanzapine weight gain with a bowl of porridge and a am bootcamp
1	enbrel proper stings the little fucker
1	subone got me fucked up.
1	rt : i hate how vyvanse makes me over think everything and it makes me angry about things that i shouldn't even be angry about
1	my blood pressure is fine, but my heart started lurching two weeks ago. savella didn't work for me, yeah. cymbalta rules!
1	2 day rivaroxaban diary. haven't yet taken today's tablet. will when i eat. still intense lower back pain from yesterday's tablet.
1	i dislike the way metformin makes my chest feel. like there's a tightness.
1	word to the wise: don't swallow cipro at all!!! it is poison and can cripple you for life! is your situation life or death?
1	the consumers and or their families who get hurt by avandia such as permanent injury or death is paid by the consumer and or the estate of
1	i'm reducing duloxitine (been on yr) and slowly increasing m but slept -14 hrs solid and still feel wasted
1	za doze ama? rt : ventolin has crazy effects walai /o\
1	i once took lunesta and i drove in my sleep. woke up in a walmart parking lot counties over.
1	i'm so irritable when my vyvanse wears off
1	right, back to bed to try and sleep again. will no doubt be another day of napping. hate changing gabapentin dose, always screws me up.
1	i have very severe hip pain. dihydrocodeine and diclofenac aren't helping. suggestions?
1	just wait for the weight gain to set in. i was on lyrica for about a year. didn't change my routine. gained about lbs
1	as are (probably) the nausea, headache, sweats, flu symptoms &amp; diarrhea. but it’s still better than being on it.
1	wish it was monday...seeing doctor tomorrow &amp; want to see if he has any suggestions for my withdrawal.
1	i wonder if seroquel /then/ food still equals restless legs
1	for the first time in ages my testing pulse rate isn't that level. mine was anxiety but pregabalin increase last fri has really
1	... gabapentin can cause you to get very hungry. just be prepared. amitriptyline...just ease slowly and use a low dose.
1	i do not like how the gabapentin makes me so sleepy ! i wish it would not do that to me. ..grrrr
1	crestor and lipitor cholesterol meds have high incidence of muscle/joint pain side effects. ask your loved ones about their muscle pain.
1	the day after my humira jab and as ever i'm mega tired. may have to go back to bed.
1	that time that tamiflu bs broke me out in hives!!
1	i started prozac a few hours ago and the only side effect i've had was some dizziness. much better than viibryd which had me puking.
1	i'm taking tamiflu and feel like i'm gonna throw up all the time
1	when i was on cymbalta and visanne i could not orgasm at all!!!
1	it all might be due to restlessness. did make my legs go too!!
1	i suppose the only concern is that the lamotrigine is toxic in fairly low doses but i haven't actually taken an od for months.
1	my afluria site is actually hurting tonight and temp is up .5 degrees. doubt i'm going to be staying up much longer
1	when i was on lunesta it was "better" but woke up in a daze. don't take sleeping pills! they are horrible.
1	metformin has the potential to cause nausea, loose stools etc. as a potential side effect
1	more like it's :37a.m. i have class at :20 a.m. &amp; this lunesta ain't doing shit
1	drugs such as vioxx, lipitor, mevacor, and crestor are causing and have caused millions of deaths worldwide.
1	feeling a bit light-headed after ventolin but i'm breathing like i'm supposed to for the first time in like years..feels great
1	i take seroquel at night, high dose. it knocks me out
1	that'll be the quetiapine making you drowsy. it's a common side effect xx
1	jalapeño cheddar cheetos and a coke to chase my adderall so i don't vom.
1	taking trazodone and literally passing out on the bathroom floor yeah that shit happens
1	the gabapentin is making me tired and the tramadol is making me light headed. am ok if busy but if not....
1	too scared to go back to sleep horrid imposing dream
1	what is the metformin for? my other half takes that as he is diabetic. it made him feel ropey for a while x
1	rt : maybe it's just a vyvanse addict thing rt : nothing more satisfying than crossing something of…
1	i'd like to thank metformin for keeping me on the couch for a week straight. drugs sure are awesome!
1	god there is nothing worse than nicotine withdrawal
1	the pathway of cipro is definitely murdering my mind right now
1	shoot out to this oxycodone for making me high af.
1	": playing league while on vyvanse is too damn stressful. back to public i go!"
1	i think my lunesta forgot how to work
1	is not doing me any favors
1	no. it turns out one of the less advertised side effects of this casually prescribed viibryd is haunting dreams and demon visions.
1	effer withdrawal.
1	i lost pounds on vyvanse &amp; that's why life is wonderful
1	effer was a boner killer, absolutely. welbutrin goes the other way.
1	increased hunger is a side effect of advair smh maybe that's why i've been binge eating and gaining weight
1	trazodone has screwed up my sleep schedule. its helping tho.
1	i take metformin because i have to, and it works. but it also makes me unable to tolerate much alcohol, and that part i hate.
1	hi there just started taking aubagio kind of feeling yucky but better than doing the daily shots lol how are u?
1	humira is the only treatment thats been effective in bringing about and maintaining remission. didn't respond to infliximab!
1	just about dead, think it's bedtime.. fuck you quetiapine
1	prednisone is slowly killing me slowly. humira got me sicker. remicade stopped working
1	mri showed lesions in my noggin got to have eeg to see if its ms or humira doing it.so more tests n messing about lolxx
1	am i the only one that grinds the shit out of their teeth on vyvanse?
1	that's what i get but the bloody quetiapine made me so bloody miserable.
1	rt : if this fuckin emt looks at me one more time hes gonna feel the wrath of my vyvanse rage
1	fanapt was the only thing that calmed her rages but comes with tremors. i'm so sorry
1	rivaroxaban is great, until your patient gets a wound and bleeds solidly for hours from it!
1	going in to see 'the one that decides you don't need any meds' doctor. think it's buprenorphine withdrawal. hospital warned weeks.
1	agree that big pharma should be interested. buprenorphine is shown to be addictive but not like oxy/hydro
1	i have a feeling i'm not going to go to bed at all tonight. damn you vyvanse!
1	popped an adderall and now i'm excessively sweating
1	taken other stuff, but can't really remember. aripiprazole &amp; ziprasidone apparently weight neutral aps. topiramate: weight loss.
1	has anyone ever taken pristiq before? i just got prescribed it because effer made me nauseated does pristiq do the same thing?
1	darvocet worked for me, but it makes my heart beat all over the place, like a john bonham solo.
1	sometimes it never ends. so sorry. topomax is miserable with parasthesia, cognitive problems, kidney stones. lamictal's good
1	what is this weird feeling i've been having all day? i've felt depressed yet oddly happy. this is the second day of bid
1	my mom took lyrica that the doctor prescribed her &amp; now she's having crazy hallicunations
1	i'm on zoloft now because prozac made me rage for no reason and i had fucked up thoughts so here's to hoping zoloft helps!
1	! anybody else fluish while on biologicals? hit sun morning, st dose on tamiflu tuesday night, off xejanz as of tues night, scared.
1	pristiq gave me sexual side effects but celexa's fine, and if i gain lbs it'll be all ass, i've been there lol
1	great.. i have hives up and down my legs from this gosh dang trazodone
1	venlafaxine definitely does mine. also makes me need hours sleep a day. hence now unmediated &amp; rollercoastery.
1	does trazodone actually make people feel like high omfg it makes me sleepy
1	&lt; i was on lamictal for a while (for other reasons) but i had to stop due to an allergic reaction.
1	i couldn't remember if i took a vyvanse or not early so i took another one &amp;now i'm spazzing out... bc obviously i took one already
1	heptotoxicity and weight gain is prime toxic effect of which antidiabetics? the glitazones; pioglitazone, rosiglitazone
1	ain felt this sick since i came down from five weeks being high on oxycodone after ankle surgery last year
1	coming off cymbalta cold turkey.. day ... i think i have vertigo! this is awful.
1	just had the viibryd vision shake thing again very cool
1	it was th period when i was still fucked up off them vicodins &amp; seroquel. i remember it was lunch &amp; i left because something pissed me off.
1	question: anyone on eeriencing urinary track infections frequently and never had before?
1	hmm, interesting. i may have been undergoing baclofen withdrawal hence the anxiety for the past few months…
1	seroquel aka wake up at :30 and waste half your day sleeping.
1	oh yep! the only trouble with seroquel for me is i don't want to get up in the morning. i've always been an early riser.
1	eszopiclone (marketed as lunesta) has also been associated with gynecomastia, not just spironolactone.
1	saphris makes my mouth numb i can't deal with this shit.
1	subone so clutch, but that orange after taste instant death
1	second day off effer &amp; on viibryd here. brain zaps are fun. and by fun, i mean horrendous &amp; miserable.
1	to be honest i've had worse. on fluoxetine i was convinced there was a plot to steal my thoughts... !
1	and quetiapine makes you gain weight i'm scared
1	humira was the last drug i tried, did absolutely nothing. doctors have no faith that remicade will be my solution, but i have to try?!
1	i don't know if vyvanse was a good idea
1	venlafaxine and alcohol- you'll cry and throw chairs at your mom's bbq.
1	i should really do somethjng more effient with my time but i need a nap. going to sleep at am &amp; waking up every so often is not fun.
1	i've taken everything but my trazodone that's tonight, but the nasal spray is giving me a drip :|
1	i wonder if olanzapine causes restless legs &lt;_&lt;
1	i've no probs with porn other than the fact that i've gained pounds on effer and no one needs to see that
1	cymbalta withdrawal is getting top billing at the moment, however. ugh! xx
1	just pregabalin (higher dose than before), ibruprofen &amp; esomeprazole but combination zonks me out.
1	ugh, maybe tamiflu isn't the greatest thing after all. it can cause insomnia and anxiety.
1	vyvanse at pm probably wasn't a great idea.. i can't sleeeep -__-
1	ventolin makes me shake
1	but has the after-sting, which is worse! yuck. reminds me, i need to go take my shot
1	they think the crestor i take is causing my knee pain.
1	cuddle with my enbrel so it's my body temp and doesn't hurt as bad
1	that suuuuucks. ambien made me a zombie. lunesta was lovely for the short time i took it. now using xanax as needed.
1	feel crap every morning. wake up after another restless night and just want to cry.
1	so it seems that if i take in am i am drowsy all day. if i take in pm i don’t sleep well. go figure.
1	gimme one reason why i shouldn't have sex drive / libido. i accept this as a part of withdrawal symptoms from venlafaxine.
1	trying to do a french manicure after several puffs of ventolin is proving challenging to say the least :-\
1	i'm not sure if seroquel is helping us or making things even worse.. anyone else knows if it can make dissociation worse?
1	i just had a look buddy, and my medication (seroquel) does affect tolerance to the sun.
1	drs had me on multiple painkillers. almost killed me. bextra vioxx fentanyl relafen . crash test patient
1	technically i had a choice. humira and/or remicade worked but gave me migraines. couldn't deal with those side effects
1	like, adderall butchered my ability to concentrate and made me angry all the time while strattera was almost perfect for me.
1	i am so tired right now. like i feel like i used to when i used to take seroquel and lithium. i haven't been this tired naturally ever
1	took a vyvanse for the first time in a month feelin weird.
1	i think it could be lowering my blood sugar too much. i take onglyza (5 mg) in the morns with metformin (1000 mg).
1	i feel like the nuvaring is making me super bitchy
1	لاتنس ان... brilinta can cause dyspnea, especially the first week. consider switching to plavix or effient if needed.
1	fluoxetine give me headaches and makes me yawn /7
1	i was allergic to hydrocodone, got darvocet
1	rt : finding out i'm allergic to fluoxetine was a bit of a shock tho. mind, only someone from yorkshire could be actually allergic …
1	i had a weird rash w/ enbrel. but it was all over my abdomen &amp; chest. rash in elbow cld b psoriasis? can u take a pic?
1	all i have done today is sleep. and i still need to sleep more. this is a welcome change.
1	the will stem from paxil w/d symptoms. mark my words.
1	8 day rivaroxaban diary. pracetamol has taken away most of the aches, but still have lower back ache and weak knees.
1	i'm sorry you have ostrich halitosis but that is a side effect of once monthly boniva.
1	if this fuckin emt looks at me one more time hes gonna feel the wrath of my vyvanse rage
1	got offered a seat on the tube this morning. quetiapine, like pregnancy, but hungrier.
1	magically my appetite has gone back to normal since going off seroquel! well, well, well - i was right, the doctor was wrong.
1	if i don't take my quetiapine i can stay awake for days!
1	not as focused no try focalin or vyvanse but vyvanse take away your hunger
1	i am on gabapentin and i feel drunk. and it is hideous. drunk is not something i enjoy. the irony oh the irony.
1	shouldn't have taken mg of vyvanse today...
1	it feels like my brain is melting. mg of vyvanse in hours... not smart danielle. not smart.
1	had a dream my eyes got burned out of my head. thank you trazodone
1	med update? mg of latuda (which gives me the weirdest feeling an hour after taking it) &amp; .5 mg of clonazepam. he won't give me more
1	weird how i have a high alcohol tolerance but don't brag about that the way i brag about imodium having absolutely no effect on me (ladies)
1	take tamiflu and drink water like crazy. i didn't and now i'm super dehydrated
1	i think i finally feel the last of the toxins slithering loudly out of my body. dr's shouldn't prescribe medicine that does this.
1	nexium may increase your risk of getting severe diarrhea.
1	wa iyyakum pregabalin aka lyrica. good and eensive made by giant pfizer. very good but can make u a lil drowsy
1	i got miralax and now i have a serve headache
1	neurontin helps my pain so much but basically puts me in a coma, of course. can't win
1	i feel your pain just got st urgh ! humira worked for me for just months then got painful reactions
1	lamotrigine also causes me to have fewer hours sleep a night
1	am on mg quetiapine. mainly tiredness it causes with me.
1	coming up this week: seroquel is notorious for two things - making you sleep until next tuesday, and leaving you a hangover. lovely.
1	man wouldn't let me tell doc. thought i'd lost mind. then the lunesta stories came out
1	i took a depakote, zyprexa, tramadol, flexeril, naproxen, a gram, blunts..... and almost died.. i turned green
1	they increased my celexa. took me off seroquel because it was screwing with my memory. i go back in two weeks to see how its goin
1	so much for no nicotine withdrawal. think i've about pissed everyone off this week.
1	albuterol be havin me nervous and pulse fast as hell
1	thanks to the oxycodone i’ve been in a pretty good dream mode at times today. still not sure if i am real or not.
1	just woke up from a hour nap thank u fluoxetine
1	lamictal dosage increases kind of wreck my head for a day or two. but they also make me super productive as long as i can do things slowly.
1	dear alternative medicine aficionados, don't do intra-nasal acupuncture when you're on effient and aspirin.
1	trying to keep up with a football game is very difficult under the influence of oxycodone
1	5 day rivaroxaban diary. neck ache and right shoulder ache. lower back pain.
1	no fail, seroquel does make you hungry.
1	been off synthroid and metformin for a week. i no longer have aches/pains in my shoulders or legs. stopping victoza, going on insulin only.
1	the oxycodone finally hitting me. literally didn't work for the first days..but now i feel it. really makes u light headed
1	time for my commute. wondering if i'm going to cope with this everyday. it's like wading through treacle getting up so early on olanzapine
1	ooh me too! rt : did not suit me at all. had severe tremors and weight gain.
1	i think my tablets have made me gain weight. anyone on fluoxetine/prozac?
1	rt : when are you going to do true life: i am addicted to vyvanse?

1	i've had too much quetiapine today - i'm zombified.
1	. ...and effient for a year...so i bleed and bruise easily now...
1	anybody know anything about side effects of venlafaxine? come off 'em wks ago, still feeling awful. physical withdrawal awful
1	i was on both, effer st, it stopped working me &amp; changed to pristiq that worked better. finding the right dosage is key
1	olanzapine is amazing srsly, the dreams are immense, no addiction, its gorgeous, like brave new world soma to me
1	talk to your doctor to see if you need to up your dose of paroxetine. it is possible to "plateau" on it..i did.
1	this cipro is totally "killing" my tummy .. hiks..
1	not sure what those meds are, but here in canada they gave me percocet which is a combo of oxycodone &amp; tylenol. it made me feel sick
1	ventolin makes me so weak holy shit
1	quetiapine knocked me sidewards for a week then i suddenly woke up activated. then relapsed, upped dose, activated &amp; so on

1	i low carb but have just eaten my body weight in freakin carbs! i only hope the carb cravings are because i’m coming off the
1	thing about venlafaxine is the withdrawals when you're late for a dose - it's like electric shocks in your brain, and they go -
1	i have a life appointment tomorrow, and i'm going to cry to her about lamictal. because it makes everything worse. i hate medication.
1	coming off of cymbalta has been the most exhausting eerience. and it isn't even over
1	really bad rls fron seroquel

1	day seven off the baclofen and i've got cold sweats and constant insomnia... i'm running on fumes at this point.
1	so, the singulair is out - did not seem to work imo. doc tried to get me on advair - insurance said no, not covered so simbicort it is. ...

1	just wondering where the side effect of hating the world is stated on vyvanse advertisements?
1	my enbrel likes to marvin gaye. i think that is fart. i just went to the diarrhea hut and babysat some dentists.
1	i finally had an appetite, made food, gone. humira why won't you let me eat
1	gonna have to speak with my psychiatrist about stopping my olanzapine its interfering with my visions and it gives you memory loss and more.
1	fuck adderall i'm tryina sleep and it's am umm??? rude
1	we sure do. or new treatments. i'm on humira now. remicade almost killed me.
1	do not ever get on cymbalta. getting off of it is hell!
1	hey not sleeping.
1	i can't wait to go get my anti nauaea meds tonight. i feel like shit. humira is definitely kicking my ass but my skin lools great.
1	binge watching upstairs downstairs on netflix. hurrah for enbrel and it's power to lift ridiculous fatigue!
1	seroquel left me with sleep paralysis. abilify left me with occasional muscle spasms. i've been off of both for nearly a decade.
1	going to add in atomoxetine for adhd, but due to strain on heart, have to lower venlafaxine :'(
1	a shug ? is that a self hug? wish i could do that - damm thalidomide
1	i reflect on the tension in my nerves and all the shaking... meditation helped me a lot.
1	is anyone else out there on latuda and have trouble sleeping?
1	does anyone on get flu iike symptoms, aches and pains, shivers a sweats i seem to get it about a week or so after i've had infusion
1	oxycodone really messes you up
1	humira why you burn my veins
1	i took pills of geodon i was rushed to the hospital they had to stick a tube up my nose ugh never again i feel so bad today withdrawals.
1	. synthroid causing freq afib. wht is my alternative?
1	i hear ya i hated pristiq bc it made me sleep like -18 hrs a day! i had no life
1	it's the enbrel that's causing the flushing and night sweats it's no wonder i feel the need to go roll around in the wet snow.
1	i would like to know what everyone else's eerience are of baclofen and clonazepam. do they get dry nose / throat?
1	i'm already taking enbrel but it's annoying and a bitch. if i don't take anything i won't be able to walk..so it's not an option
1	luckily i had spare keppra and vimpat on me phew! i was given lorazapam for status a few months ago.. lost days of my life!
1	i had terrible joint pain with remicade. i switched to humira and have had no major side effects.
1	sos i havent slept for hours im on adderall i cant scream
1	steady dose of meds, anti-inflams, pain killer and lots of water. uloric is by far best but kills ur gut.
1	have to go to a doc now to see why i'm still gaining. stupid paxil made me gain like pounds and now i have to lose it
1	's vioxx was rushed through by the fda, too - and killed my husband. testing results were distorted, hidden. fda was complicit.
1	i'm feeling extra ocd right now. like chill out melissa. my vyvanse has me wired or something....
1	whilst palpitating thanks to ventolin
1	it has nothing to do with any of that~ apparently seroquel makes you gain alot of weight -__-
1	i wish i hadn't taken levaquin and prednisone right before bed.
1	oxycodone screws with your stomach and makes you feverish haha whoooooo i don't feel great
1	i was on humira but it gave me lupus. i just started plaquenil and have been on celebrex for years. how do u like remicade?
1	it has been a good day today after a rough week of tecfidera flushing. let's hope for a good night's sleep.
1	if u r on and have respiratory probs - see ur doc. that how it all started of me. be well. nice chatting,
1	why seroquel can make me put on over kg: it acts like an insulin blocker or something.
1	...my old ones! plus caffeine in the morning counteracts these quite nicely whereas quetiapine hangovers were unshiftable
1	i was on cymbalta for over a year. in the process of quitting it because it interacts badly with my testosterone blockers.
1	i feel your pain. and i tried the ambien and lunesta route but that stuff made me feel stupid.
1	popped a zinc lozenge, i'm sweatin
1	dissociative fugues &amp; loss of empathy since age , serious cardio problems since age , almost dying of paxil withdrawal , that's a-ok
1	how is it that vyvanse gives me dry mouth, but i still produce this much saliva in my sleep?
1	baclofen gives me a head high but it makes me feel like throwing up after. ugh.
1	i think taking advair literally made me shrink an inch because i've been '9" for years and the last year i was measured as '8" twice wtf
1	well! that was icky. i think lamictal and lexapro do not get along when taken within hours of each other.
1	vyvanse and adivan....its ws a crazy night my heart stopped for like seconds. woke up in the mental hospital.
1	but first! try these lovely pharmies! &lt;— can’t cum feel numb hate life more and everyone else ? _o
1	do any of my friends who take pristiq have problems with nausea? ):
1	i feel like a drug addict taking seroquel every night.. but oh well, great sleep beats no sleep. except the shitty feeling when you wake up
1	not even taking my adderall is helping me concentrate on my career counseling reading.
1	hi i was taken enbrel for months but i had to stop it i was getting bad side effects
1	&gt; want to do paper to have free weekend &gt; too tired and delirious to start &gt; also too wired from residual effects of adderall &gt; dead
1	just had my enbrel injection for this week.. can just tell straightaway when it's hit a bad area in the stomach ouch
1	metformin gives me a bad tummy but im on it for the forseable future
1	i'm having the worst withdrawals from my paroxetine. is this real life?
1	get well soon, sir. levaquin did a number on my joints a few years back.
1	just had a marathon sleep past hrs on new dose of -hope my liver will be ok on it.woke with stressy tummy pains.
1	hey guys don't forget to refill your paxil for like six days because the withdrawal is like heroin. literally.
1	and with seroquel i take half of a mg pill. and it knocks me out; i can sleep for straight hours
1	oxycodone makes you have the craziest dreams.
1	i was prescribed levaquin w/ prednisone x in mos. permanent nerve &amp;tendon damage. there are hundreds of thousands of us.
1	everytime i take a adderall now at the end of the day i get sick and start puking
1	oh that was only last night when i was delirious on quetiapine - you took advantage of the situation.
1	amitriptyline is great at night, but it knocked me out too much. diclofenac is a bit stronger than naproxen
1	i take a mg vyvanse and focalin and feel nothing...
1	took a darvocet &amp; two benadryl. my butt is going to be knocked out in the next hour or so
1	this higher dose of is making me extremely tired and anxious. is this normal?
1	subone is making me gain weight. it sucks. did u gain weight? just curious
1	use advair for asthma. side effects include nihedeidneeideneidheidehsiwhswisheisheisheix and worsening asthma symptoms...lol what
1	i was on that before i started enbrel &amp; methotrexate. it didn't really help my arthritis but hopefully it helps you out
1	why can't i sleep like a normal person. oh yeah because i suffer from insomnia and trazodone gives me headaches
1	wondering if tamiflu could make one not sleep. me and mom cannot sleep.
1	4 day rivaroxaban diary. atrocious backache despite having taken paracetamol an hour ago. gone back to bed.
1	i couldn't tolerate it so then i went to humira injections. didn't work now i'm on remicade every weeks.
1	lowkey high af in class off these oxycodone
1	taking it for depression mainly but i'm skipping an extra dose each week, i'm on viibryd . yeah cymbalta made me dizzy
1	rimonabant is associated with short-term memory loss
1	enbrel is killing my leg tonight. thanks for hitting the muscle and making me bleed so much donna
1	etonogestrel subs, eert says is secreted on daily basis in the bloodstream causing uterus lining to thin out thus preventing pregnancy.
1	since swapping my quetiapine doses around, my hunger and cravings have gotten so bad!
1	gabapentin and amitryptylinr made me very drowsy! propanalol made me dizzy (but i have very low blood pressure!).
1	each brain is different. the ssri i'm on has worked really well. prozac made me a zombie.
1	and now i can feel the seroquel melting my brain, so it's time to sleep. may my dreams be filled with visions of mechanical sex.
1	have run out of olanzapine, was tapering off anyway but this is a bit too quick-feel restless. hot bath and diazepam time
1	i've tried every nsaid going diclofenac didn't ease much, the nerve meds gabapentin etc gave severe side effects xxx
1	rocephin + ciprofloxacin = me barely able to stay awake
1	. at last, a good side effect. couldn't go back on seroquel due to diabetes risk.
1	wide awake and this trazodone starting to feel like a sugar pill.. i'd actually prefer to be at work right bout now.
1	nah, subone it's cool, iont ever wanna sleep again ever anyways bro.. just keep doing ya thing bruh
1	"u wailed all night; now y'r disembodied sobbing all damn'd day, ghost?" • effer-xr®discontinuation syndrome ain't exactly heaven, angel
1	oxycodone got me feelin' some type of way
1	but i have realised that it's the lamotrigine which causes the joint pain.
1	i'm certainly weird but it's quetiapine instead of crack, i can't get that on prescription.
1	can't even take a seroquel cause i gotta wake up smfh
1	i was literally on percocet darvacet motrin and vicodin. nothing. made it better. nothing.
1	cause humira gives me a lot of rashes and like most of these drugs.. skin sensitivity happens
1	i'm desperate for better diabetes education for my dr after nearly dying after misdiagnosed metformin induced lactic acidosis
1	rimonabant is a generic acomplia for long-term weight loss. you will lose weight in a short time.
1	partly true but olanzapine is the worst ever for inducing carb cravings for some unfortunate ppl serequel and clozaril a nd
1	i think the lunesta is interacting with the vyvanse because i am definitely drilling a mint
1	paxil withdrawal is nasty. do not like.
1	no one ever tells you that lunesta gives you late night cravings until you can't fit into your dress pants for your presentation tonight.
1	bupenomroph something like tht they downstairs also been on pregabalin wow
1	day : the initial lamotrigine lethargy kicked in the day before exams. i tell myself that possible failure is better than possible death.
1	asians are at higher risk for severe allergic skin reactions to carbamazepine. phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and lamotrigine are alternatives.
1	getting a seven page text of garbled ramblings from someone detailing that their titrating of venlafaxine led to a break up is unusual.
1	on tecfidera since feb this year. all ok. slight flushing some days but nothing to worry about.
1	quetiapine made me eat all the sweets, the sour ones seem to help with the dry mouth
1	exhausted...can't fall asleep. don't wanna take a trazadone and wake up hungover.
1	i need to start taking my viibryd again but it makes me feel so nauseous ughhh
1	told va last year, crestor worked for me, did not cause muscle pain; on my rd cholesterol med trial, all cause muscle pain.
1	i'm coming off of my two day adderall stint and my emotions are just not having it
1	did you know insanely intense dreams are a known side effect of venlafaxine? it's not an antidepressant, it's my dream fuel!
1	ugh i wish my vyvanse didn't make my stomach hurt so bad
1	for anxiety to penetrate through my drowsy haze (a result of the triumvirate of fluoxetine, pregabalin, amoxicillin?) is pretty good going.
1	understand why my specialists told me to but big bags of mints when taking gabapentin driest mouth every and drinks don't help it
1	no joke! worked like a charm for me, til my immune system went poof. hopeful about
1	this seroquel is hitting me soo hard with this beer
1	i take pristiq and i have headache do you think of it?
1	i took a nexium why do i feel the burnies
1	can reducing fluoxetine zap me of all energy?i've reduced from a high dose, now on standard does &amp; not feeling good at all.
1	not to worry - just a bit of temporary fuzziness. i've been on humira since &amp; love it.
1	don't worry, i am just fine! apparently i am just highly allergic to tamiflu and it caused me to break out into a terrible case of hives!
1	i'm on the twitter-machine tonight cuz can't walk or do anything else tonight. boosted neurontin dose has my motor control jacked up. :-|
1	years ago i was on darvocet post surgery. it made me suicidal. % loss of control of my mind, and it was frightening.
1	def vicodin lol i'm on oxycodone that shit knocks me tf out i'll be talking then i just pass out lol
1	i had to taper myself down. i think the seroquel gave me lasting sleep paralysis. i've had it ever since.
1	i stopped taking my seroquel because i hate it. i can barely function on it, hopefully my cpn &amp; psychiatrist can advise a 'nicer' med.
1	that's the hardest part: difficult to willingly self-inflict pain.
1	screw you paxil! you do wonders for anxiety but you make me a ultra lightweight
1	that seroquel had me sleepy as fuck alllll damn day
1	half of seroquel knocks me out so fast and im asleep for at least hours...
1	no getting itchy is just a common side effect of oxycodone ": are you allergic to any meds?”
1	pain mess don't work i take mg oxycodone every hours plus lots of neurontin and valium and ativan it all does nothing
1	count kum hai, can't avoid it being a nicotine addict. :/
1	"i'm hereee" *runs out half asleep, in pjs and hair a wreck* "thanks dude. adderall saves lives"
1	only one day in and mirtazapine is like fluoxetine all over again, it just makes me so tiered
1	i have been on enbrel, remicade, and simponi. enbrel didn't work well enough for me.
1	hot flashes won't be around forever; but weaning of paroxetine could be a nightmare
1	it's very tough. i understand, &amp; you have my full sympathy. how did you find cymbalta withdrawals?
1	yeah i hear epilim is pretty tough, sorry to hear re bad times with it oddly, dear sweet lamotrigine tipped me to a dark place
1	being sick every morning is getting really old. not sure if anxiety or my body getting used to paxil. anyone know?
1	bisphosphonares such as actonel raise bone density but make them brittle. for example glass is dense but brittle.
1	one of my brothers is addicted to subone &amp; it terrifies me that it could kill him my whole family is on drugs or alcoholics
1	pretty sure the quetiapine was affecting my sense of taste
1	i feel your pain, im allergic to penicillin, ammoxicillin, levaquin, doxycycline. it sucks
1	i can relate to the olanzapine lbs, but you'll be great!
1	i hope buscopan works.... since loperamide and the other one didn't
1	rt : dabigatran not working in this obese pt, maybe contributing to his stroke. saved by tpa.... speechless
1	ugh, lunesta has the worst aftertaste ever. forgot to use my peppermint oil tonight. =.(
1	i had the two humira shots today and the needle didnt hurt at all but the medicine inside burned like lava
1	i feel siiiiiiiiiiiiiiick. damn you venlafaxine.
1	i haven’t changed any meds, been on the tramadol &amp; pregabalin for months now. it’s odd! i look like i’ve been in a fight
1	seriously, when i get a man i'm gonna have to take my nuvaring out, i never even think about sex but with the pills
1	i've self-induced brain fog atm cos o amount of buprenorphine i've taken to get thru pain &amp; injuries from cleaning &amp; packing
1	the drugs don't work!!! from fit to hobbling in a few days. off the pills but may need wks to recover &amp; be prone to ruptures
1	dr. stephen huff: pinpoint pupils? think olanzapine overdose!
1	hahaaaaaa! i highly recommend sildenafil citrate for cardiac related issues. may cause stiffnessness.
1	i think my xarelto is causing bruising...it might be an adverse reaction....smh
1	i can go without nicotine for a few day but by the time the third day comes around i want to rip out my teeth
1	the levaquin is very strong. not too many side effects for dad. it just takes away all his strength.
1	i'm having to pee way too much this drive.. drinking too much water. fuck you mg vyvanse and your ability to dehydrate the fuck out of me.
1	after having an allergic reaction to remicade &amp; developing antibodies to humira i now have had a reaction to the flu &amp; pneumonia vaccines.
1	advair is bad for your bones i hope i don't end up with osteoporosis
1	quetiapine. very low dose even with increase. helps me get to sleep (&amp; eat in general) but feel really groggy in the morning
1	i'm too high on oxycodone for my tooth ache to check x:
1	does anybody else take metformin and has a horrible taste in his mouth?
1	meds paranoia cos my leg is itching
1	end point choice is critical. crestor produces lower ldl levels than generic statins but same or worse adverse cv events.
1	she and i are both colon free now, so no humira or remicade! they failed miserably at helping us.
1	took adderall and got my homework done quicker than eected now i cant sleep
1	fluoxetine is a hell of a drug if you're into being awake all night and feeling ill.
1	i love the gorgeous burgundy color and powdery mouthfeel of the advair
1	why do i always get the seroquel munchies!?
1	when u havent shit since sunday so u have to take miralax twice a day and it doesnt work
1	.sevenkg. not good at all. seroquel will do it's best to make those numbers bigger so now i have to really watch what i eat.
1	toothache. discovered that somewhere in the paracetamol, codeine, sertraline combination there is a bad mix.
1	i'm prolly going to because lunesta doesn't work for shit
1	cymbalta makes me thirsty to the point where my mouth is painfully dry. it feels like the sahara desert in my mouth.
1	advair really messes you up jesus . all of these asthmatic kids ripping their clothes off...
1	whoa, on the topamax?! the saphris is what causes my nighttime craziness (haha), topamax cuts off the cravings, keeps me in bed
1	rt : personal frustration med's that work (humira) then wear-off even when taking mtx for anti-bodies.
1	when ur miralax didnt work and ur still backed up
1	": no shit ": diclofenac and blood pressure are not best of friends""
1	question time does anyone suffer from egg burps? what works for you
1	i used to take trazodone. made me sleep for dayyssss
1	fluticasone puts my ass to sleep
1	no = eat everything in sight.
1	*gets addicted to metformin (it gives u the poops)*
1	i'm not even sure what to request. :/ sertraline makes me sick now, venlafaxine made me sick, reboxetine and citalopram useless
1	so i took a adderall last night...i'm still awake.
1	arms stil hurt. cipro to tendons is like a razor to rope: cut it partway through, makes it weaker &amp; won't heal ever. damned cipro.
1	-nods- my zombie-ness when i first wake up in the morning is mostly from my nightly meds too (seroquel).
1	(tw body image) the gabapentin made me put weight on and i've never felt so bad about my own body before. people tell me
1	days ago i quit subone cold turkey. i am in the worst pain of my life. thank you for the inspiration, and i love you. christopher
1	so that would elain the bronchitis.... it may not be an allergy, but the effects of using advair over a long period of time
1	psssh didn't levaquin make u hallucinate? girl u best stay away from shrooms lol
1	is that like quetiapine. when i had to take that crap i could not stay up longer than hours
1	lunesta is a joke. why am i awake right now?!
1	already has a higher risk of blood clots than other hormonal smoking &amp; being overweight add more risks.
1	so unfair, i never get the good side effects of meds. ativan, seroquel, &amp; ambien xr make me feel so drink i cant really walk &amp; im nauseated
1	suffice to say i am not particularly a fan of quetiapine sponsored dreams
1	nawh bactrim. cipro made me sick once.
1	avelox got me. central nervous system breakdown.
1	after my embarrassing sweaty incident during the show yesterday, i looked it up, and whaddayaknow, sweating is a metoprolol side effect. ew.
1	pregabalin for the pain. hello new meds! has anyone tried this before? makes me drowsy.
1	hey gurrrl, it might just be the januvia talking but i have severe abdominal pain that may be severe pancreatitis and lead to death.
1	the only medication (of which i am aware...and i know almost all of them) that has a regular headache side-effect is lamictal.
1	oof, sympathies. i had a raging cipro headache last week.
1	hates it when i get asthma attacks and the ventolin doesnt seem to work.
1	i better go to bed.. effer withdrawal makes me feel kinda terrible ugh.
1	tell me about the medications you've used that do work &amp; that didn't work! remicade &amp; humira didn't work for me but cimzia does!
1	cipro is awful makes me sick as a dog too
1	just took my geodon and i'll be lucky if i'm asleep in hours.
1	good. i'm afraid to use my advair since the thrush infection
1	subone withdrawals
1	rp mcmurphy was right about the trazodone being my new favorite bed-buddy. rip, melatonin dreams. you were getting too weird - even for me.
1	fucking vyvanse, giving me cotton mouth. ugh.
1	my husband can never work again. there use to be a discussion board for consumers that were involved in the avandia lawsuit
1	this new medication is kicking my ass. and i feel flushed. hope i make it through the night. restoril is not playing around
1	(cont'd) my pdoc altered the dosage of to mg. that's the only alteration. because i complained about the extreme fatigue.
1	holy shit, that trazodone actually knocked me the fuck out and took me for a ride
1	remicade didn't work for me. humira is working (thankfully) so i have to say humira is better
1	taking synthroid for my thyroid disease has weight like falling off..... besides my tummy &amp; their being a baby there i feel like a skelton.
1	crestor causes diabetes....google it.....
1	i need to progress onto oxazepam.apparently it's more sedating. seroquel is sedating, but you can hardly open or close your mouth.
1	i resent taking olanzapine as it is the side effects of olanzapine that were mistaken for negative symptoms of schizophrenia
1	trazodone is what he gave me while ago. that shit had me all tore up. i didn't like that shit haha.
1	i was so excited to go see animals and hang with my friend and his son but i can't stop puking. fucking subone
1	some day i should try fluoxetine again. it made me all suicidal the first time, but i was
1	also so glad they gave me percocets instead of t3s. oxycodone helps so much more than codeine. inb4 opiate withdrawels though.
1	i essentially felt nothing on them. great for anxiety, bad for living. coming off klonopin and paxil was hell though.
1	the enbrel that i was taking to help my rheumatoid arthritis was doing a good job, but it crashed my immune system. it is a drug
1	yes, humira didn't work for me and i lost a ton of hair on it i've been on remicade since surgery in ..been in remission
1	advair is disgusting. in case you were wondering. it gobs up in my throat and i gag like the cat trying to hack up a hairball.
1	seroquel and coffee don't really mix oops
1	soooo i wore gray yogas &amp;took an adderall &amp;left my book bag at home. so what if my ass sweats. now what's gonna hide it?? shoulda wore black
1	one of the most common side effects with metformin is gi complaints – in most cases, start low and titrate up slowly
1	it is totally stupid withdrawing from temazepam has been awful &amp; i'm only
1	yeah, that was a great fucking year. that's when paxil entered my life, and made it worse. years time sure helps, though.
1	that moment when neurontin prevents me from waking up for school
1	your humira shot burns with the power of a thousand suns
1	my favourite things about fluoxetine are: it doesnt work as an antidepressant. increases suicidal thoughts. it stops you from jizzing.
1	actually i have! spoke gp abt pregabalin as mood very flat &amp; not helping pain so going change it.dropped last night &amp;...
1	so damn sleepy. this seroquel is fucking me up so bad.
1	i haven't taken my vyvanse in three days. i also haven't slept more than hours each night oops.
1	sure is! i no longer even own a car after being crippled by cipro (a bayer product!). who needs a car when you can't walk!?
1	packing whilst eeriencing venlafaxine withdrawal is pretty hellish. got to keep track of my med times.
1	days on &amp; i'm still recovering from my first etonogestrel reinsertion.. what a girl will go through to not get pregnant these days!
1	so, i lasted days on seroquel. i couldn't handle the awful side effects. constantly dizzy and lightheadeded &amp; a myriad of other bad stuff
1	well, i'm now convinced humira &amp; enbrel were the culprits of my weight gain! other tnf will likely result in same. now what?
1	so, my pregabalin was supposed to be being increased...but is now being decreased due to horrible dry eyes and mouth side effect.
1	rt : hungover shakes + vyvanse shakes + coffee = recipe for success
1	aft yrs following dr's presc of vioxx &amp; /day began to notice personality changes. new dr said only tylenol - normal
1	darvocet never worked for me. currently prescribed hydrocodone, robaxin and an anti-nauseal.
1	how to sleep when still on adderall step : close eyes step : open eyes step : stay up because you're not going to sleep, dumbass
1	desvenlafaxine makes you lose weight though because you can't eat anything on it, it's killer. but it's been keeping me saner.
1	okay, if there is no association between efavirenz and suicide, why are my friends on efv trying to kill themselves?
1	my mri scan shows when it happens but it could be a "reaction" to being on infliximab this time, as i did not react on the humira
1	why couldn't you get addicted to cialis. then i could call you cialis connor. adderall conner doesn't sound cool.
1	seriously if you are getting off cymbalta tape alot if movies i was up till and feel and look like a zombie just to tired to growl !!!
1	at least u can admit it rt : only thing is nuvaring will turn you into an emotionally unstable bitch
1	i do wonder of that achille's will ever recover fully from the cipro.
1	saphris even in a low dose gonna knock me out
1	i hope you're better soon! i'm sorry the tamiflu didn't work, but glad it didn't do anything weird! i had bad side effects.
1	it's my nicotine withdrawls
1	plus jenifer helped me with my sister jennifer who died maybe from lyrica you guys are the best
1	ok has anyone here taken restoril a pill to help insomnia? i stopped taking ambien, bc i was gaining weight (sleep eating.)
1	your lucky! i have to do infusions of remicade for my ra. i would happily do humera or enbrel if it didnt make me stop breathin
1	my hopes &amp; dreams of my itchy legs totally fading with new synthroid dose has been crushed. back with a vengeance &amp; literally in tears.
1	i'm fine w/ advair &amp; flonase. prednisone = rage monster.
1	i haven't eaten since noon sunday adderall is a hell of a drug
1	how do you like the copane?? thinking of switching to it. on tecfidera now but not liking the weight gain and hair loss.
1	hugs i have been put on gabapentin and it is giving me migranes
1	olanzapine is supposed to make you a fat bastard i got off lucky. lithium makes my hand shake. bipolar or schizo drugs.
1	rt : paxil makes it nearly impossible to cry.
1	venlafaxine hangover finally starting to shift after huge mugs of hot water with giant pieces of lemon...
1	i'm not taking my meds tonight. i think latuda makes me hallucinate more than normal. i can't deal with it
1	had my adderall for the first time in forever and i'm wiredddddd
1	i'm on gabapentin now, it's not really working for me..but everyone is different. gabapentin makes me feel drunk
1	i can feel my heart starting to palpitate from vyvanse, red bull, and nicotine. that's probably par for the course for finals week, right?
1	but i switched to trazodone ... i was doing some crazy ish on ambien smh not good lol
1	im diabetic - i was on metformin since and had this yr b taken off it harmed my kidneys. i am on meds for diabetes now only diet.
1	i really feel like this fluoxetine is messing with my perspective time and people.
1	i was on methotrexate side effects were awful now i'm on enbrel and it kills me to say its not as good as methotrexate !
1	i tried humira first and no luck. after infusions of infliximab noticed a huge difference. hope it works for you
1	effer i found was not so bad. currently on cymbalta &amp;the wdrawals are vile. internet full of horror stories,
1	i’m going to try for sleep. real sleep. not that light bastard that brings me.
1	plus: enbrel totally helps with the fatigue. con: enbrel does f*ck all for pain.
1	vyvanse makes me think too much
1	synthroid is causing freq afi. what is my alternative???
1	this increase in pregabalin (on fri) is making me so tired and a wee bit dizzy but anxiety is calmer when i feel like this
1	stopped zoloft cold turkey after i became suicidal, stopped effer because i was numb.
1	i've probably gained a good seven or eight pounds on paxil. my '2 and small frame can't deal w that. lol get me off the crazy meds asap!!!
1	i reckon i have drug-induced oedema causing musculo-skeletal pain. likely drug combination: rivaroxaban, losartan, and simvastatin.
1	"vyvanse was like aderall and crack i got ten minutes of sleep pearl"
1	i used to be on paxil but that made me more depressed and prozac made me angry
1	consider nuvaring or orthomicronor (the mini pill) bc they both cause less weight gain!
1	benzos don't work for me &amp; i've had a cracker of a panic attack on seroquel. listening to people chat on podcasts helps me.
1	it can get really cold when you have a halls lozenge
1	damn, i'm so proud of you!! i'm still limping from the levaquin cure for my pneumonia that dissolved left knee cartilage...
1	mad adderall = no sleep
1	right now i can't tell if i'm wide awake or exhausted. day of cutting viibryd in half is almost complete.
1	so i've been on metformin now for days (for my newly diagnosed diabetes)... man it's knocking the crap out of me.
1	that is what my neurologist thinks too. he is eert on longevity. i take lipitor. violently allergic to crestor
1	my breath smells awful (thanks vyvanse) anyone have gum
1	the website for lyrica says "elimination half-life of about hours" the last time i took was at about pm last night leh! why still dizzy!!
1	thank you so much for getting the message out...wish i could see the film but bayer crippled me with cipro back in !
1	i did crazy shit on ambien and lunesta was trash. i've tried everything. this makes me fall asleep the best.
1	lose potency or we get immunity to them remicade cimzia now humira friend
1	&amp; this is what happens right before the seroquel knocks me on my ass. i ramble on &amp; on about shit. lol yay life
1	my last trip to quetiapine world nearly ended my marriage
1	maybe cos of the insulin blocking effect of seroquel but i do feel sugar crashes when eat fast carbs. will feel ill. so avoid where poss.
1	what i take is serious. i never was informed ahead of time. i could get "metabolic" syndrome from seroquel.
1	nope, i tested positive for jcv. jcv &amp; tysabri = permanent brain damage or sudden death.
1	why must lunesta make my mouth taste all bitter eww
1	hrs sleep last night but stayed awake today. lethargic &amp; low still. in bed &amp; can feel myself going hot &amp; cold
1	woo it's so awesome when my adderall makes me have a rapid heart rate when i run so i look like i'm about to have a heart attack
1	someones said can happen while fighting infection which is quite possible,nearly finished some cipro&amp;bringing up foul gunk!
1	so anyway last night.. my new medication (venlafaxine/effer) made me feel the most depressed ever, and i overreacted about everything
1	had to stop tysabri due to pml (i think that's what it was called) risk. new med coming in feb without risk factor
1	thanks to nuvaring my period was only days long
1	my parents had to pick between remicade or humira. plus my docs added methotrexate. both remicade &amp; humira failed.
1	okay, can't take lunesta now and get up on time so please mellow me out and get sleepy ms. xanax. gotta be able to be fun and loud tomorrow!
1	okay, mg of memantine a day seems to have stopped the worst of the panic attacks. now i just had no motivation. :/
1	nuvaring use to stab my dick head. .. and it moves around
1	lamictal nap ft. cups of caffeinated coffee
1	i was on tysabri for months. i'm in the process of going to tecfedera. it is similar, i needed to get off because of veins
1	victoza makes me have no appetite at all!!
1	i think it’s an snri, i’m not even sure. it’s viibryd. but none of my anti-depressants have ever messed me up like this before
1	all birth control makes me fat and disgusting. i've tried like four different kinds, two pills, the nuvaring and the depo
1	totally down with possible decreased appetite/decreased weight side effect of this pristiq tbh
1	i rilly want to get off cymbalta but i don't want to suffer through terrible withdrawals
1	i hate to hear that. taking seroquel is like swallowing a sleeping pill when u wake up then trying to function normally
1	i'm gonna sue you bastards for making me take ventolin my whole life and now i can't get off the stuff
1	i am still laughing. this is what weaning off of paxil and being a moron does to you.
1	yeah i feel you lol i’ve heard some stories. darvocet will knock you out too
1	i've taken a temazepam so struggling to say what i mean clearly sorry
1	dr wants me to use fluticasone nasal spray but it's hurts when i spray this mess up my noise...sinus infections problems!
1	i have been on enbrel for months and eeriencing shortness of breath and lung congestion. anyone else eeriencing this?
1	i'm too numb to feel, blow out the candle, blindness
1	high blood sugar despite victoza, metformin and pioglitazone forced me to try something.
1	the lunesta didnt even work
1	fell asleep lastnight with the laptop on and all phones plugged-in. accidentally disconnected wifi. gabapentin knocked me out cold.
1	and it's that horrible time where it's too late to take lunesta or i'd sleep till in the afternoon
1	df188 au diclofenac ?rt ": the doc gave me these painkillers that have wezad me a good one... "
1	seroquel is enough to make the average person pass the fuck out. seroquels doesn't even phase me. something is wrong here.
1	levaquin poisoned me and ruined my life! constant pain /7! i hate you, levaquin!
1	i guess this is what i get for doubling my vyvanse
1	ah yeah some strong pain meds are hard on the stomach.. cipro is good shit....i thought you had a reaction to it awhile back
1	i realized it the viibryd but i swear i never been but it's in the morning . i can't sleep , so it's git to be building up
1	abilify for weeks has made me lose /6 of the weight i put on w/seroquel, and i've been eating like shit. i love you abilify!
1	i used my kid's nebulizer with albuterol once. ho-lee crap. i was vibrating for like an hour.
1	off venlafaxine which was pure hell for me, i can't switch these meds anymore, tired of feeling like shit all day.
1	wow my meds really strong but they keep the pain away neurontin mg it's just getting used to them being weaned on them side effects rough
1	omfg this metformin is not agreeing with my stomach one bit
1	oh, what a great idea watching gordan ramsay cook at am when i'm hungry from my seroquel.
1	i'm so fine today. increasing zyprexa,my condisition is became so good. it has a side effect that increase my weight. i must care about it.
1	thinking it might be the baclofen doing it.only on a low dose though.broken sleep is a nightmare.
1	i never had bleeding or vomiting just alot alot of fatigue and face was pale and lost tons of weight..
1	because i realized vyvanse after a certain time of taking it increased my anxiety and made me more irrational.
1	i switched my advair for cymbacort doesn't burn my mouth
1	have any of you developed knee pain since starting tysabri ? what helps with the problem ?
1	holy shit my spacer seriously amps up albuterol like i am shaking
1	i had allergic reaction from enbrel.
1	/swiftly taken off that for vimpat. vimpat made seizures less well controlled but less side effects. on that i had speech/

1	doctors, why am i more wheezy since starting ventolin and flovent ? i want to be able to breathe again.

1	any of you tecfidera ever get a really intense flush? feel like i just walked off the surface of the sun, this one is intense
1	rounds of puking, a nasty headache, and my throat is raw. body wants nothing to do with this increase in the geodon.
1	quick fix, meant to write not the anal leakage drug that was often rx at the time. meridia had its other fun side effects.
1	i took a vyvanse and drank a oz redbull this morning. my heart was hurting a lil bit haha
1	adderall makes me the happiest person alive...and then it wares off and turns me into a horrible person. lol night and day.
1	need to switch bc def allergic to cymbalta
1	maybe it's just a vyvanse addict thing rt : nothing more satisfying than crossing something off your to-do list.
1	coming off is harder than u think. nausea sickness hot and cold shivers twitching headache
1	attempts at lamotrigine withdrawal, commuting by train every day and being back at work in a new role
1	best of luck man! and they do suck :/ i was on olanzapine (abilify didnt work)...was awful, gained stone. off it nw n doin gud!
1	ugh! the cramps from these atorvastatin are awful
1	although my bitching about being fat did look a but comical next to my brother, with his olanzapine induced weight gain.
1	repeat methylcholine test today. bleh. i'm so shaky after the ventolin they gave me that perhaps coffee is not such a good idea.
1	i was fine w/ effer. paxil/seroxat/paroxetine was the worst fucking bitch ad i've ever withdrawn from. pure evil.
1	blargh hate this. particularly with seroquel at night. i not i don't sleep. if have and have more cant get up :/
1	i hope so too. remicade didn't work for me but humira is doing great.
1	starting an imodium routine. not my favorite drug.
1	i start on tues b/c of so i know. it helped but it then destroyed my lungs.
1	i have some seriously disturbing dreams. thanks thanks a freaking lot. well i guess it's better than being ..only just
1	kind of moot now, imo, bc nobody's giving me sulfa drugs again, or taking me off celebrex or lamictal unless i get the rash back
1	took too many hits of ventolin this morning and am now remembering why i don't smoke crack anymore
1	that sucks. humira made me so sick. remicade helped a but, but then seizures put that out. now waiting, just prednisone now.

1	i'm tired of being tired, deffinatly time for this girl. stupid
1	hi chris, try diclofenac ,30mg, times daily, best anti-inflammatory gives great pain relief, but you need to take omeprazole
1	i keep telling myself am, but i think the trazodone fucks it up. it knocks me right out and won't let me wake up.
1	actually fit into a larger "l" sized shirt today! goodbye xxls! almost a month neurontin free. thank you god and zeal wellness.
1	for the record, the tamiflu didn't actually help so much as make it last less time seemingly. it's also supposedly really dodgy

1	i just got diagnosed a few weeks ago with bpd...they put me on seroquel and kept me on zoloft with it. it makes me eat a lot.

1	everyone: i have a drug addiction to seroquel, i take a year, help me stop
1	it's like i've been drinking all day.. except, there's no pissing with ventolin
1	what! nightmare made me jump awake! not nice at all. thought was supposed to keep me asleep through the night

1	cymbalta withdrawals. need to get script. head is spinning. blood pressure low. i hate depending on drugs to live.
1	darvacet was taken off the market because yrs later they say it causes heart attack, yeah but to abusers of the drug. it's a good pill.
1	nb: not psychotic seroquel used off-label for ptsd. ctl’d many sympts, helped sleep. but side fx - weight gain - caused terrible pain.
1	annnnnnnnnnnd here goes the last week of viibryd withdrawal. super neat.
1	the humira helps me. i took remicade before that, but it stopped being effective. i'm a fan of humira.
1	have decided to stop metoprolol and pain relief, sort chest infection and just see if can find normal and go from that point
1	that's great! i can't take humira, allergic to something in the med. enbrel flared my migraines. remicade is end of line for me!
1	that nap was on point.... cymbalta did that shit cuz i dont take naps...ever

1	oxycontin is a long acting oxycodone product that can cause constipation
1	shouts out to seroquel for giving me that blessed h sleep tho
1	olanzapine actually makes you put on weight, even when you aren't eating that much
1	i suggest never stop taking effer abruptly because you will feel like you're on your death bed
1	and "we" eected and stated vioxx was safe and effective. reduced swelling and caused attacks
1	just took a gabapentin now i'm sweating
1	take paxil then. no anxiety just happiness. but you et withdraws if you forget to take it.

1	yeh same bk felt like sumo wrestler on it all time think its f****ed me life ironic as humira is used to treat artheritis
1	try it! humira did nothing for me, either. remicade is taking a long time (months), but i'm finally seeing some progress.
1	i would not recommend toying around with cipro if you don't have to. did you know it can cripple you for life?
1	pregabalin made me bonkers.but i found strong volterol suppositories (same dose as post op) really help. help with cyst pain x
1	that's how i felt about humira. when it stopped working, i had a whole summer in and out of the hospital
1	alright time to find out if a shit ton of vyvanse and not sleeping for days can get a trimester worth of homework done for classes

1	the goal is to not get thrush from my symbicort
1	yeah, you'll suffer no matter what. i would say subone withdrawal is worse than methadone, but both are pretty horrible.

1	all the things i have just make me sleepy as hell: cymbalta, klonopin, ambien. wait what if i take em all togethhssaagg
1	oh, and i forgot that with lamotrigine come awful night terrors. i woke up no fewer than five times screaming and sweaty.
1	i've had ocd symptoms like that for a while but seems like the seroquel exacerbates things and now this. :\
1	can also get "extrapyramidal symptoms" ie tremor from olanzapine.

1	when the depression is coming out caused by this damn levofloxacin
1	has anyone used januvia with metformin ? i slept for two weeks , any one similar to reassure me ?
1	took , maybe minutes to go from "why isn't the seroquel working" to "what is a bed, i will just use my keyboard"
1	lexapro made me lethargic but also affected my sleep (insomnia) and had a few other issues. taking pristiq now, works for me.

1	as an adult i was on adderall along with zoloft and chantix. i was so angry and confused and depressed i couldn’t function.
1	this prolonged release metformin isn't working so well.
1	ah the sting of the injection. how i've not missed thee.
1	i might go back on the venlafaxine &amp; give it another chance but it was wrecking my sleep x
1	what's going on? ever since i stopped taking klonopin and viibryd i've had the reoccurring feeling of shock impulses. wtf?
1	have been in a lot of pain all day though and i feel and look like a zombie. seroquel is quite an annoying medication, ugh. -.-

1	i took too much inhaler during dancing and i got the shakes and started getting dizzy ugh ventolin overdose

1	taking gabapentin is proving to be difficult... soo sleepy and hyper at the same time. chronic pain sucks!

1	important counselling point for sildenafil - swallow tablet with a full glass of water quickly as it may cause a stiff neck
1	you are the buprenorphine to my opioid withdrawals. hahaha
1	to take my seroquel and have weird dreams or to not... real life lyndsey world questions
1	wow. venlafaxine and mirtazapine must be very sedative. i’ve had them before separately n was knocked out-ishx
1	but rimonabant caused severe depression and thoughts of suicide. not a good thing.
1	may have been the mix of diclofenac &amp; aspirin. heart started to beat fast, after focus wore off.
1	it's not even pm and i'm already feeling the venlafaxine withdrawal. stupid bitch. how hard is it to pack the bloody tablets?!
1	uncontrollable tremors in hands and legs. body would rock all the time. restlessness. desperation.
1	quite a lot left over from back problems. gabapentin are pretty trippy too dont really need em anymore. good for emergencies
1	sweaty fluoxetine addict
1	thank god i was born with so much hair; i wouldn't been bald by now.
1	lmao rt “: went from a full dose of paxil to nothing for the last three days and now i totally understand the plot of fantasia”
1	where are y'all. good grief! i didn't even get one reply... discrimination! guess my parents don't matter. vioxx killed mom.
1	waitt..here it comes..the is pulling me under..also i now have the sudden urge to procure food..
1	food doesn't help for energy, not sure how to get some get up and go!
1	vyvanse evidently doesn't care about my bed time
1	i had been blaming my dizziness upon standing to my menopause but now on hrt &amp; no more flashes so looked at cymbalta side effs
1	this seroquel got me sleepy
1	pristiq somehow doesn't make me less horny, but when i gain weight it's only in gut so i can't do that
1	no one likes me on my vyvanse
1	i confused my metformin with my antibiotics and overdosed. bad stomach cramps. i'm a moron.
1	fine whine sweet basic bone bad breath bad diarrhea a horse ebooks fart yogurt turd fever full. of what? januvia
1	eired pregabalin = disturbing nightmares that youre not sure youve woken from...although it could just be london.
1	dickkick/withdrawal symptom of flu shot i got last wednesday when i picked up my subone at the pharmacy at rite aid in milo i doubt it
1	?oh god never do a ventolin right before bed
1	thanks seeing rheumy april , i just think i maxed out my neurontin &amp; it's not working anymore:/
1	"how do u do it? u got me losing every breath. what did u give me to make my heart beat out my chest?"
1	but i don't want to take an ambien or trazodone or anything because i dint wanna restart my dependence upon them
1	shitty ass ventolin not even helping
1	not only is he suffering from the flu symptoms but he is also being affected by the side effects from the tamiflu
1	husband said i was a little 'high' tonight so encouraged me to take mg of olanzapine. now feel really really really sleepy, zzzz....
1	it's disgusting how they portray it, i delayed starting methadone for far too long when subone wasn't working because of stigma.
1	question for all enbrel users. is it normal for injection sites to become a bit tender &amp; red?
1	i find the baclofen worse, it has left me in a tired/sleepy fog all day - the codeine i can (mostly) deal with.
1	well......well damn. i used to take ventolin but it didn't do anything for me. i told my doctor that i had to have symbicort
1	viibryd day one. i think it made me super sensitive to sunlight but benadryl does that too, so.
1	racing next sun so thought i'd better try on my tri suit. so depressing, can just about get into it and look like a whale ffs!!
1	the effer may have been pushing me toward hypomania, so we are trying just an ssri, then see if a mood stabilizer is needed.
1	i've got a doctors appointment in a week. will discuss adding low dose of antidepressant again...something not as "addictive" as cymbalta...
1	popped a seroquel now i'm sleepy
1	gonna watch the sunrise.. vyvanse got me up. i have only slept about hours in the past hours. mg got me fucked up
1	yes def eat or the cipro will tear u up and feel better
1	im on cypro . actually in dying on cypro
1	well i took an adderall so no wonder i can't nap
1	i take olanzapine and have a permanent dry mouth what can i do to help it
1	quetiapine side affects are increased appetite and cravings. it all makes sense.
1	he said usually ppl taper off effer, bc it’s a rough one to stop, but since i was starting viibryd i should be ok.
1	i knew one day enbrel would b the death of me
1	hello, world! quetiapine zombie this morning and i have a work call in about minutes. perfect combination.
1	": this nebulizer makes me so aggy ", i got this inhaler my mom bring me called symbicort work wonders ask your doctor, sip lean .
1	that day you don’t take spiriva until noon, which is body clock pm. no wonder i felt tight. hi, prednisone, too. jeepers.
1	i'm not allowed to take seroquel &amp; neurontin &amp; then go cook food cause i nod out like i'm on dope &amp; make a fuckin mess whoops hahaha
1	... used to be on them ...worst was the psychotic episode when starting but one of my favs
1	9 day rivaroxaban diary. aches are related to pressure on my body, e.g. if sitting then in back, buttoocks and legs /2
1	infliximab but i kept getting perianal abscesses and developed fistulas, thats when they moved me onto humira
1	venlafaxine withdrawal is horrific
1	my mind races when i'm on a vyvanse
1	oooh. lightheaded today. switching meds, it's been a few days without pristiq (the one i'm going off of) - withdrawals are fun.
1	welll..decided to get off paxil. withdrawals are killlerrr, like loss of circulation randomly in areas.
1	after going into anaphilaxis w/remicade i am nervous to start humira after being off it for a year, anyone know about this
1	minus the skin reactions, this week i can say i think enbrel is helping
1	i've had to reduce the quetiapine back to mg. couldn't take the increased gastro pain. was crumpled in a heap crying x
1	metformin is keeping my energy low
1	re ooh in mancs today are there any pr nsaid alternatives to diclofenac i had a patient allergic to diclo but fine on others
1	bedtime. hopefully the headache and nausea from the levaquin will be gone leaving me with only the more common side effects of antibiotics.
1	with effer if i miss one day i am dizzy and wrecked
1	that's crazy because i took keppra which put me on suicide watch. i'm on vimpat now and it's decent.
1	well i just found out that it is indeed possible to abuse imodium and get high off it.
1	rivaroxaban diary ctd , neck and should ache, lower back pain and knee ache.
1	yea it does, i just throw it up.. next one in line is my one januviaor sitagliptin its called.. was a docu on mine recently
1	hate that i've been off for ages now and my appetite is still terrible. the worst part? i can't bear meat or chocolate :'(
1	no stomach probs for me, thank goodness. before this i was on viibryd &amp; my stomach was a mess!!
1	q makes me hungry. olanzapine made me want to eat my own arm!
1	“: my vyvanse makes me nocturnal ”
1	but still dr. maria jasinskas was right &amp; would have been if not for pharmacy; she said, "you know sometimes vyvanse can make you depressed"
1	so gonna need dr's note after all. dr told me to drink plenty of water if advair gives me a headache...
1	just took seroquel. now i'm freaking out that i will end up sleeping hrs and miss my pm appt tomorrow
1	well. i abruptly stopped taking lamotrigine (lamictal), and that is why i am having the pain and weakness. possible seizure. oops.
1	i've heard a lot about tummy problems and metformin
1	he mentioned effer but cant take it cuz i was on it &amp; geodon the same &amp; ended up in the hospital,dont know which caused it
1	metformin got my stomach hurting like shit.
1	since i stopped synthroid, metformin and victoza i have much less aches and pains. wondering if i even have
1	pristiq and i don't mind them sometimes but sometimes they're really emotional and i can't sleep then
1	okay i took the seroquel and i am resisting the urge to vomit it up i feel disgusting but oh well good times good vibes don't be sad
1	damnit!that elains why i have a stomach ache &amp; my headache hasn't gone away-i took mom's metformin instead of motrin!-mamie
1	anyone on pristiq withdrawals?
1	i haven't had an orgasm in a long time.. wtf..
1	i have been on most meds. humira did a number on me. infliximab never really helped and i developed reaction as most people do
1	lalalalala.. clearly i've underestimated my vyvanse by choosing to take it in the middle of the day.
1	question: recently i have been hyper-sensitive to different textures, does anyone know if this is a bipolar / lamotrigine thing??
1	are you depressed? are you anxious? do you like headaches and diarrhea? if you answered yes to the last one, then viibryd is right for you!
1	day of completed. 2 miles of walking. can't run even if i could because of cipro. also day of mostly raw was good.
1	fluox a friend years, but switch to cymbalta anti-depress/pain control. i ocd worry. can't stop running mind
1	can't even enjoy this banana right now because of fuckin vyvanse what is life
1	nonstop sneezing. darn it ventolin
1	symbicort never fails at giving me heart palpitations to the point where i think i'm about to have a cardiac arrest.
1	i'm a bit drunk its my prozac
1	apologies if gatecrashing. i was like walking dead when first started venlafaxine, much better now dose stable
1	my doctor gave me paxil, which i think is similar but it's made me feel like crap.
1	metformin is the worst medication ever. makes your mouth taste like iron
1	enbrel is literally the worst part of my week. it hurts soooo bad!!!
1	really??? i will check her out right now ... lyrica didn't work, celebrex &amp; nsaids hurt my stomach, cymbalta does just ok
1	is my memory really bad due to mg seroquel and mg cymbalta or the bipolar itself? i'm not remembering conversations
1	“: i don't know whether my vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my vyvanse addiction.” omg so true!! ahh!
1	enbrel is a miracle but it made my eyes worse so couldn't have it anymore
1	elephant tranquilizers, or seroquel paired with xannys. that combo will knock you out. so i've heard.
1	natural don't work for me, try mg of seroquel...you'll sleep for days, i have insomnia that's what they give me lol
1	have taken the trazodone dose back down. simply cannot put up with feeling tired all day!
1	pop a trazodone i have fuckin dry mouth
1	two nights ago i was so fucked up coming off saphris i was literally praying, "save me from destruction."
1	only fuck with salamol really but micrograms is too weak these days but ventolin doesn't work ain't easy being wheezy
1	copane, betaseron, tysabri didn't work. only thing helping at all is rituximab. my neuro sent me to ut southwest
1	rt : what i lack in money and personality, i make up for in paxil induced impotency
1	diclofenac makes me sick, naproxen makes me depressed and ibuprofen isn't a long term solution.
1	0 day rivaroxaban diary. headache over right side of head; lower back pain. wrote letter to my gp &amp; his colleague outlining problems
1	vyvanse keep me straight but i can't eat shit when i'm on em
1	anyone else have worsening problems since starting for autoimmune disease?
1	s th day with still eeriencing some side effects (drowsiness,sleepiness,gi effects). moderate improvement in mood
1	crestor muscle problems
1	i hate to be all anecdotal evidence-y but i was assured taking enbrel wouldn't make me get sick more. i got a cold day after my nd dose.
1	i took a oxycodone on a empty stomach for my cramps... i feel like shit man i'll never do that again
1	my dr. will be starting me on humira cuz i had no luck w/remicade. hope u're better soon -positive
1	the comedown on adderall is so fucking annoying
1	i'm gonna make a list of drugs that give you mad crazy dreams. trazadone and metoprolol are at the top.
1	the cymbalta certainly is addictive &amp; its fda approved...
1	that seroquel has been given me some seriously fucked up dreams.
1	just got prescribed to oxycodone and i can't feel a damn thing
1	despite a difficult meeting with hr today i feel good, i feel chilled, i feel happy but i still feel fat!
1	r u on any meds? my dreams on seroquel are fucked up
1	whoah so dizzing. damn tamazapam - shld probably wap back to quetiapine if this keeps up! but it makes me feel so ick!
1	my creativity was blocked by lithium and prozac and wellbutrin and paxil and zoloft and effer and lexapro and cymbalta and abilify-
1	just woke up. since i started on the higher dose of quetiapine i'm sleeping even more &amp; i feel knackered when i wake.
1	you prescribe me advair and it ) didn't relieve my symptoms and ) gave me hallucinations. i hope you end up broke under a bridge.
1	i think the sleepiness from the gabapentin increase may be starting to wear off.....fed up with sleeping all day
1	omg seroquel. that made me crazy town. i hope it's a low dose. so it's almost midnight. last gulp now, and sober tomorrow.
1	i ain't trying to take this seroquel yet. i'm not ready to be sedated and completely unconscious till tomorrow.
1	i'm on the remicade. hope humira works for you. i can't get rid of the dry skin thts my only problem so far.
1	united health insurance and wouldn't let me buy pristiq pills to prevent debilitating withdrawal. it's gonna be a looong night!
1	over-eaten again just before bed. stuffed. good chance i will choke on my own vomit during sleep. i blame
1	i didn't take a zopiclone in the end.. but i'm third day of no quetiapine &amp; i'm eating incredibly differently!
1	or maybe that's the prozac ugh i need a nap always
1	this week i officially stopped taking my quetiapine. i'm happy to be able to have a life again and not sleep + hours.
1	bought ourselves an electronic cigarette for fun and now i think we're addicted to nicotine
1	do i come off my medication or do i just continue to be a prozac zombie
1	if they forced you to take paxil that is aspirin/arsenic it will burn out your receptors and immobilize you
1	when i'm trying to eat a decent meal on adderall i feel the struggle of the kid in matilda who was forced to finish the chocolate cake
1	lunesta is working right now, too bad it didn't work when i took it last night
1	i didn't find it any more sedative than just venlafaxine alone. prob a little less so
1	feeling a little dizzy from the quetiapine i just popped!
1	my old ones took days for withdrawals but effer which i'm on now i will get them the next day :/ i wish i could email you valium
1	ty, its nasty. they bleed for ages bcoz i'm on rivaroxaban which is like mega warfarin so don't clot easy. then they ooze 'stuff'!!
1	i knowwishful thinking. my humira shot doesn't even work for me anymore and when it does i get so sick.
1	some people see more blue from double blue cones. also sildenafil side effect.
1	pop a ciprofloxacin i'm sweating woo!
1	i am never taking baclofen and norflex the same day again. first i felt super drowsy but now i feel extremely high and it's freaking me out.
1	it was elained to me that all the anti-tnfs can bring out other issues. i had severe joint pain on humira &amp; remicaid
1	another night of ‘light’ sleep. feel low. subdued. sad.
1	ugh the olanzapine makes me so tired
1	that's good news. you must feel a bit less stressed. btw, are you ok with diazepam and fluoxetine? take both and they space me out
1	vyvanse makes me so fucking talkative i feel like a normal person
1	i think i'm that too! had rare breastmilk production on quetiapine, ultra rare hallucinations (not psychosis) on valproate.
1	take adderall so you dont feel like shit from adderall wearing off then take adderall when that adderall wears off then take adderall whe...
1	months of no treatment. went back to my original rheumy and she's trying to get me back on remi. i was allergic to enbrel
1	going back to bed for a nap. seroquel has turned me into a zombie again today.
1	rt : i don't know that one, but metho made me sick everyday i took it. i had to stop. enbrel has worked wonders for m…
1	nd attempt in as many weeks to 'enjoy' a glass of wine didnt go to plan. venlafaxine and wine do not mix. gin and tonic next then!
1	week into metformin and the heartburn &amp; lower back pain are going to drive me mad. no digestive issues though, so i guess that's something
1	have been on humira years now n get on off chest infections that sometimes need diff pills sort out should i b worried?
1	i think this olanzapine makes me crazier.
1	&amp; i'm about to be sick af tomorrow because i ran out of paxil
1	at the end of most working days! i still have to nap loads just to get through a week. some days better than others
1	brisdelle dangerous. paxil is supposed to treat depression and suicidal thoughts. i took paxil and got depressed. went off &amp; ok in wk.
1	no side effects for me. i had a bad allergic reaction to remicade years ago. humira has been my saving grace
1	cant cope coming off feel like iv got a hangover mixed with flu symptoms. total nausea &amp; i cant keep still. please hurry &amp; pass
1	jesus christ those symptoms of serious side effects for whatever the hell crestor is are the symptoms of pancreatic cancer.
1	half a subone tab feels like takin norcs.. it's an opiate blocker for people comin off heroin and shit like that
1	“: i'm sleepless, you've got me wide awake” my song to vyvanse and mdma
1	one of the things i hate most about quetiapine is when i take it for the first few hours i slur my words, so people assume i'm merely drunk.
1	havent been able to take my neurontin because that combined with all my other meds makes me to tired
1	popped a vyvanse i'm tweaking. whoop
1	anxiety has been so high. but yeah, if your dosage is high its hard to come off. i had to detox from pristiq (its cousin drug)
1	yeah, ambien is also addictive, so short term is the goal. ask about seroquel? tell the doc about all the health stuffs though
1	because my dr switched from celexa to paxil and,paxil made me feel sick
1	vyvanse literally causes me to get like schizophrenia but i hear answers idk but i like it
1	metformin still makes me want to puke after all this time
1	deciding against taking adderall today because i think i want subway later.
1	oxycodone just makes me ears rumble and does like nothing else
1	side-effects of loperamide include: . diarrhoea . skin reactions . abdominal cramps
1	pristiq and im livin in a cold world
1	ok i've got a med ? anyone ever tried cymbalta?? my doc put me on it but i slept hrs straight!!
1	i'm on nuvaring too! my cramps are pretty bad on it too.
1	good luck. i went the aubagio route. so far so good. feel better. i think tysabri was hurting my joints. less pain
1	good luck! i have been such an insomniac lately and even my lunesta isn't working! sleep tight gorgeous!
