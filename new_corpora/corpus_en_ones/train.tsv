1	two weeks back on paxil. i have no more depressed thoughts or feeling ls but i also have no feelings at all again.

1	i was having ; itchy feeling all over ,skin felt like it was crawling, muscle twitches, this always lasted over hours after taking saphris
1	this increase in pregabalin (on fri) is making me so tired and a wee bit dizzy but anxiety is calmer when i feel like this
1	i haaaated trazodone. don't be afraid to ask doc for something else if side effects continue. gave me migraines.
1	this flovent hfa inhaler will make me gain weight. i'm not liking this, but i'm not liking an asthma attack either. :-/

1	hey is not going to cover stelara anymore. humira and enbrel don't work for me. what can i do? any help?
1	i feel so pill-ill again - decided to seriously cut down to just weekly enbrel and metho alongside daily nsaids .
1	i had allergic reaction from enbrel.

1	i’m going to try for sleep. real sleep. not that light bastard that brings me.
1	taking advair on camera doesn't confirm you have asthma, don't play w thse drugs they can cause pancreatitis evr!

1	tysabri bruises are the best
1	paxil withdrawal is nasty. do not like.
1	i'm having the worst withdrawals from my paroxetine. is this real life?
1	hate that i've been off for ages now and my appetite is still terrible. the worst part? i can't bear meat or chocolate :'(
1	i suggest never stop taking effer abruptly because you will feel like you're on your death bed
1	its quetiapine for me. i was wearing factor today &amp; i still burnt
1	suffice to say i am not particularly a fan of quetiapine sponsored dreams
1	i'm so over metformin and progesterone, i seriously feel so drunk when i take them that i'm literally stumbling all over the place!
1	oxycodone makes you have the craziest dreams.
1	sometimes my humira pens make me feel like i'm years old due to the joint pain everywhere.
1	sometimes it never ends. so sorry. topomax is miserable with parasthesia, cognitive problems, kidney stones. lamictal's good
1	same here, i’m on etanercept for as and have the jab each year, makes me feel ill.
1	no med orders til effer is fully exited. still having brain shivers, but mostly when i don't eat.
1	i swear, since i went on lamotrigine, i've become dyslexic..what the fuck is up with that?
1	: any ideas on treating depression naturally paxil is making me gain unwanted pounds and water weight...thanks
1	oh robitussin dreams are notorious. although what will really turn 'em into a bunuel movie is cipro.
1	i wish reductil was still available. fuck the whole heart attack thing, it was a compulsive overeaters very best friend.
1	me too, remicade for a year, humira, and had an allergic reaction to cimzia, almost killed me in november.
1	merck was sued for $6b because man died of a heart attack using vioxx and this was after years of trials and usage.
1	really, i'll ask my doctor about switching. lunesta makes me oversleep and
1	ffs!! i'm getting shooting pains down arms &amp; legs now &amp; in eve whole body ache is horrible
1	ok has anyone here taken restoril a pill to help insomnia? i stopped taking ambien, bc i was gaining weight (sleep eating.)
1	plus this antibiotic is making me stupid and clumsy. cipro is evil but the fever is gone.
1	i'm in so much pain now... tendonitis, headaches, cognitive issues... i feel violated.
1	not to mention the thousands of people online who say they’ve stacked on the weight due to taking seroquel.
1	eat my trazodone then go to bed, wake up in the morning with holes in my head
1	rt : dabigatran not working in this obese pt, maybe contributing to his stroke. saved by tpa.... speechless
1	effer withdrawal.
1	"i hate because it makes me crazy revved up but i also hate because it gives me ""stupid head"". ah, bipolar i disorder "
1	hugs i have been put on gabapentin and it is giving me migranes
1	my ex was on geodon and she had a seizure in the latrine at ait. i would just fall asleep at metro stops, restaurants
1	hi! i recently switched from powder enbrel to pre-filled syringes. they are far more painful to use, do you know why?
1	monique thinks the grapefruit i ate &amp; latuda made my depression worst, lol
1	i'm allergic to diclofenac i'm on omeprazole to protect my tummy
1	high blood sugar despite victoza, metformin and pioglitazone forced me to try something.
1	i would think so because adderall makes you not want to eat even more? probably get sick maybe
1	my dreams became vivider i think with effer
1	subone got me fucked up.
1	""": i'm feeling pretty good for only having one hour of sleep"" adderall will do that to ya."
1	personally i prefer staying up until i get hallucinations, to taking seroquel to get to sleep, but only because it's more fun for me
1	you are the buprenorphine to my opioid withdrawals. hahaha
1	this lozenge has made my throat so numb!
1	lunesta is a joke. why am i awake right now?!
1	wow adderall makes me such a tweak .... aka everyone should stay ft away from me today
1	ah the sting of the injection. how i've not missed thee.
1	why do i not remember going to bed or waking up (the answer: probably seroquel)
1	the seroquel is addictive a d they deny it.
1	half a subone tab feels like takin norcs.. it's an opiate blocker for people comin off heroin and shit like that
1	basically body wants/need to purge, you take imodium you end up much sicker for longer. i almost took imodium before i puked.
1	yep. pristiq stopped working. i've been phasing off over the last week. these past -5 days have been very rough.
1	i'm doing my enbrel tonight. that means i'll have a nice big red patch on my leg for the first day of school wow nce!!!!!!
1	it's called seroquel prolong (quetiapine). apart from the weight gain, i am actually quite happy with it.
1	so while i'm letting the thoughts of lamictal/fatal rashes/tonsillectomy/spinal tap settle, i'm going to go rescue a budgie.
1	herxing is like being a giant ball of pain and insomnia. advil, painkillers, imitrex, and lunesta don't touch it.
1	time for my commute. wondering if i'm going to cope with this everyday. it's like wading through treacle getting up so early on olanzapine
1	have you tried cimzia? i'm on it currently bc humira failed and remicade gave me lupus. it's alright. a lot better than humira to me!
1	yeaa bihh all jacked up on vyvanse!
1	the amount of adderall shits that will be taken in the lib this week is disturbing
1	if i don't take my quetiapine i can stay awake for days!
1	i had panic and aniexty orders a few years ago before i took paxil but i never freaked out on ppl and cried hysterically
1	i'm gonna sue you bastards for making me take ventolin my whole life and now i can't get off the stuff
1	it was back in the fda warned celebrex could cause heart issues. about the same time vioxx was taken off market.
1	gabapentin &amp; tramadol don't work for shit. make me sick. i hate them but can't get others
1	6 day rivaroxaban diary. particularly bad lower back ache had not eased by 0 so went to bed. much better when i woke at 0.
1	r u on any meds? my dreams on seroquel are fucked up
1	“: i'm never tired at night ” adderall
1	since i stopped synthroid, metformin and victoza i have much less aches and pains. wondering if i even have
1	well. i abruptly stopped taking lamotrigine (lamictal), and that is why i am having the pain and weakness. possible seizure. oops.
1	i fell asleep and woke back up again. trying a quarter of a seroquel instead of half this time. i'd like to get out of bed tomorrow.
1	apparently lunesta and stairs are not a good pair!
1	after the lunesta kicks in, i'll forget everything. lol
1	my mom is aged . she changed anti-depressants from aspen trazodone to zoloft. she has itchy scalp &amp; hairloss. could this be
1	this night of no sleep is brought to you by vyvanse.
1	synthroid causing afib so days ago i quit! today all my joints hurt! will start back on it tmr!
1	no. it turns out one of the less advertised side effects of this casually prescribed viibryd is haunting dreams and demon visions.
1	tim pre diabetic and insulin resistant. my endocologist has prescribed victoza injections.my appetite seems to be suppressed.
1	this subone got me feeling super sick, idk why i tried this malarkey
1	today i'm an emotional mess. that's what happens when i think i could wean myself off of cymbalta.
1	doc for panic disorders: alprazolam (addictive) and paroxetine (sedating).
1	"humira commercial: ""this is humira giving me my life back"" mom: ""this is humira giving me anal leakage"""
1	steady dose of meds, anti-inflams, pain killer and lots of water. uloric is by far best but kills ur gut.
1	i tried humira first and no luck. after infusions of infliximab noticed a huge difference. hope it works for you
1	oh, it sucks, but try doing snri withdrawal. they had to put me on a whole other drug just to get me off effer.
1	second day off effer &amp; on viibryd here. brain zaps are fun. and by fun, i mean horrendous &amp; miserable.
1	rivaroxaban /2 lower back pain. not very pc but am crippled by this drug. taking more paracetamols. must ring for 'phone consultation.
1	cymbalta makes me thirsty to the point where my mouth is painfully dry. it feels like the sahara desert in my mouth.
1	i know it made me want to be sick every time i had it plus fluoxetine is the bigges bunch of shit ive been on worse than sertraline
1	side-effects of loperamide include: . diarrhoea . skin reactions . abdominal cramps
1	if this fuckin emt looks at me one more time hes gonna feel the wrath of my vyvanse rage
1	sibutramine makes me not hungry and also not even thirsty
1	my afluria site is actually hurting tonight and temp is up .5 degrees. doubt i'm going to be staying up much longer
1	fluoxetine, got me going crazy.
1	feeling a bit light-headed after ventolin but i'm breathing like i'm supposed to for the first time in like years..feels great
1	no stomach probs for me, thank goodness. before this i was on viibryd &amp; my stomach was a mess!!
1	ace news x i'm on extavia but skin reactions are painful- thinking of just doing gluten free and see how i go x
1	need to switch bc def allergic to cymbalta
1	anxiety med &amp; cialis for a side effect caused by saphris effect while we wait for lamictal to work.
1	i need more medication than this.my body is already building a tolerance for the prozac i've been taking.
1	i spoke to my consultant about this and he said a lot of people get panic attacks as a side effect of humira and infliximab.
1	trazodone is what he gave me while ago. that shit had me all tore up. i didn't like that shit haha.
1	let's talk about how i forgot what adderall felt like and now i'm on it again and i'm going nuts.
1	"""i'm hereee"" *runs out half asleep, in pjs and hair a wreck* ""thanks dude. adderall saves lives"""
1	i hate to hear that. taking seroquel is like swallowing a sleeping pill when u wake up then trying to function normally
1	recent spell in hospital and olanzapine sloth/weight gain
1	"seroquel census: ""did we kiss?"" (notes i scribble next to my bed at am, loopy on anti-psychotics)"
1	they increased my celexa. took me off seroquel because it was screwing with my memory. i go back in two weeks to see how its goin
1	anyone on cymbalta it is making me like a zombie and still hating the world.
1	my hands &amp; legs are holding a hate campaign against me. i can see us falling out if they don't sort themselves out
1	rp mcmurphy was right about the trazodone being my new favorite bed-buddy. rip, melatonin dreams. you were getting too weird - even for me.
1	yes, i go in tomorrow for more testing but it's been years of pain. remicade, humira both failed to work.
1	still no reply. still cut off and isolated...on duloxetine and sick but still forced to care...well done!
1	day cold turkey from effer. i bellevue this pic adequately represents my descent into madness. or whatever.
1	i lost effectiveness on humira, and then methotrexate was added and it was like going back to starting the drug.
1	“: i don't know whether my vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my vyvanse addiction.” omg so true!! ahh!
1	i'm not sure if seroquel is helping us or making things even worse.. anyone else knows if it can make dissociation worse?
1	actually it was more like a prison but with nurses instead of guards, olanzapine pill n im=
1	0 day rivaroxaban diary. neck ache and lower back pain. had to kneel on floor to get out of bed.
1	abilify for weeks has made me lose /6 of the weight i put on w/seroquel, and i've been eating like shit. i love you abilify!
1	question: recently i have been hyper-sensitive to different textures, does anyone know if this is a bipolar / lamotrigine thing??
1	why i came off it. gp told me its not dangerous but it is damn unpleasant. at least i know it's the quetiapine that's causing it
1	crying randomly at nothing and everything. sigh. thank you can you just exit my system already.
1	whilst palpitating thanks to ventolin hooo im so high
1	i just had a look buddy, and my medication (seroquel) does affect tolerance to the sun.
1	after my embarrassing sweaty incident during the show yesterday, i looked it up, and whaddayaknow, sweating is a metoprolol side effect. ew.
1	ventolin was pretty harsh, i remember that racing heart feeling.
1	but i have realised that it's the lamotrigine which causes the joint pain.
1	humira made me have a bad rash on my stomach and broke out with bad psoriasis on my leg. can't wait to start remicade
1	and now i can feel the seroquel melting my brain, so it's time to sleep. may my dreams be filled with visions of mechanical sex.
1	"my mri scan shows when it happens but it could be a ""reaction"" to being on infliximab this time, as i did not react on the humira"
1	also, tmi, but the tummy issues i had w viibryd have disappeared! i don't have to buy tp but the case anymore!
1	coming off of cymbalta has been the most exhausting eerience. and it isn't even over
1	whilst palpitating thanks to ventolin
1	lamotrigine causing steven johnson syndrome
1	"talk to your doctor to see if you need to up your dose of paroxetine. it is possible to ""plateau"" on it..i did."
1	i've been on paxil for years for depression/anxiety and at first it used to help but i guess i've built up tolerance and i come too fast.
1	only had the gabapentin today and i am feeling it now. god my feet hurt!
1	been on humira now short period to injections no noticeable change in pain but racing heart and palpitations. mtx at ml injection.
1	i took pills of geodon i was rushed to the hospital they had to stick a tube up my nose ugh never again i feel so bad today withdrawals.
1	anyone who will listen: never ever take effer/venlafaxine. paraesthesia abound.
1	allergic reaction to . feel free to share &amp; distribute. kill before it kills us.
1	yea still a vampire as still on cipro wbu? xx
1	"had a migraine, asked him for medicine, he's sitting there like ""that's what you get! nicotine withdrawals!"" like fuck dad."
1	people taking - does this need to sleep /7 go eventually? cos this is not sustainable beyond the short term.
1	2 day rivaroxaban diary. haven't yet taken today's tablet. will when i eat. still intense lower back pain from yesterday's tablet.
1	years ago i was on darvocet post surgery. it made me suicidal. % loss of control of my mind, and it was frightening.
1	i feel for you, i had the sane eerience of disturbed sleep &amp; bad dreams on venlafaxine xx
1	lbs in days. obvious now that i should have stopped the quetiapine a long long time ago before i got in this state
1	after taking olanzapine i wake up and feel like i am in a straight jacket because my muscles feel stiff
1	how anyone can say there is no withdrawal from prozac withdrawal is beyond me. their answer is to go back on it and up the dose.
1	same with venlafaxine, user i spoke to yrs ago stopped taking that when she started having acid like trips losing hours at a time
1	i'm on nuvaring too! my cramps are pretty bad on it too.
1	erm my pdoc wants me to go back on quetiapine. pointed out it had caused a heart arrhythmia last time. going back to gp to look at my ecg
1	not being able to go without the assistance of miralax - enemas/suppositories aren't working and even with miralax no complete emptying
1	shitty ass ventolin not even helping
1	on today's ride i burnt calories. take that olanzapine you hunger inducing bastard!!!
1	i feel like a drug addict taking seroquel every night.. but oh well, great sleep beats no sleep. except the shitty feeling when you wake up
1	have decided to stop metoprolol and pain relief, sort chest infection and just see if can find normal and go from that point
1	had my weekly etanercept last night. working better for me than methotrexate did
1	cipro has a known warning of weakening the achilles tendon. ...
1	crestor and lipitor cholesterol meds have high incidence of muscle/joint pain side effects. ask your loved ones about their muscle pain.
1	hate prednisone yet need it. humira tried to kill me. so did remicade. so..
1	quetiapine withdrawals.
1	im on cypro . actually in dying on cypro
1	geodon was also *very very very* hard to get on and off of. i feel asleep at my desk for weeks lol
1	does anyone on get flu iike symptoms, aches and pains, shivers a sweats i seem to get it about a week or so after i've had infusion
1	lunesta is working right now, too bad it didn't work when i took it last night
1	lexapro gave me the worst mixed episodes. i have some instability with pristiq but i can manage it ok.
1	i hav to come of the duloxetine immediately as i hav a terrible rash because of it! had the rash weeks
1	saying that, the whole reason i gained weight in the first place was due to the drug olanzapine. doctor's fault. ah well.
1	day of viibryd and am having trouble sleeping. in fact wide awake. i hope this side-effect goes away. still depressed of course.
1	i had infliximab yrs ago but had severe reaction after nd dose. now on humira &amp; doing great!
1	i'm so allergic to trazodone but i haven't been taking it so no one believes me :::---))))
1	the fact i talked to for minutes last night and didn't remember at all is just proof lunesta really works
1	oxycodone really messes you up
1	anyone have nerve damage symptoms (ms like) from enbrel or humira?
1	he has me on ciprofloxacin and phenazopyride i had severe pain that started over the weekend when trying to use
1	stopped zoloft cold turkey after i became suicidal, stopped effer because i was numb.
1	a mixture of diazepam and temazepam to make myself sleep was maybe not the greatest idea. i feel like the whole world is spinning around me.
1	yea it does, i just throw it up.. next one in line is my one januviaor sitagliptin its called.. was a docu on mine recently
1	alright time to find out if a shit ton of vyvanse and not sleeping for days can get a trimester worth of homework done for classes
1	promise, brownies honor i'm not stupid, i have been forgetting everything lately
1	rt : what i lack in money and personality, i make up for in paxil induced impotency
1	i always get a mild injection site reaction to enbrel and it burns going in (though less than humira did) but its not enough for ...
1	could have used you last week. pt was not please with my, clonidine, hydroxyzine, loperamide solution to her withdrawal issues.
1	the only pt of mine who ever died was one age profound autism chronic underwt &amp; gi issues, given lots of cipro. terrible
1	yes def eat or the cipro will tear u up and feel better
1	not sure the paxil is working any more
1	oh yeah! i was on fentanyl but it numbed my brain much. buprenorphine is helping me better w/o making...
1	how do guys ejaculate on paxil??
1	what problems did you have with humira, if you don't mind me asking. i tried infliximab it destroyed my liver.
1	off to the doctors to talk over what's next, seeing as how pregabalin does nothing apart from make me dizzy
1	diclofenac gives me a serious heart burn.
1	etanercept (enbrel) which can be got in pens, but the preservative stings, so he mixes his own&gt;
1	end point choice is critical. crestor produces lower ldl levels than generic statins but same or worse adverse cv events.
1	taking trazodone and literally passing out on the bathroom floor yeah that shit happens
1	not sure whether tis buprenorphine or pregabalin causing itchy skin but i really need scratch mitts :-/
1	i remember i took mg of geodon on accident and slept for like hours
1	/swiftly taken off that for vimpat. vimpat made seizures less well controlled but less side effects. on that i had speech/
1	0 day rivaroxaban diary. woken up by pain in neck, hips and legs.
1	thank you! i have high hopes. was on enbrel + metotraxate before and stopped working
1	hi there just started taking aubagio kind of feeling yucky but better than doing the daily shots lol how are u?
1	trying to force myself to sleep on adderall is fucking impossible.
1	subone withdrawal is so much fun
1	the lunesta didnt even work
1	i tried ambieb, lunesta and restoril, none work. my ex used to get so messed up when he took ambien but it doesn't affect me.
1	saphris even in a low dose gonna knock me out
1	with the tysabri i don't ache much but i do at times. with the rebif i ached so bad it was unbearable at times. flu like symptoms i had.
1	after a 'friendship' since childhood, i can't believe that ventolin and seretide have now decided to work against me.
1	have been in a lot of pain all day though and i feel and look like a zombie. seroquel is quite an annoying medication, ugh. -.-
1	"no getting itchy is just a common side effect of oxycodone "": are you allergic to any meds?”"

1	januvia could make you hungry though. and irritable. hangry.
1	i feel like the nuvaring is making me super bitchy
1	yup quetiapine. the normal dose at night whacks me out. i'd have been asleep til friday on double

1	the drugs don't work!!! from fit to hobbling in a few days. off the pills but may need wks to recover &amp; be prone to ruptures
1	magically my appetite has gone back to normal since going off seroquel! well, well, well - i was right, the doctor was wrong.
1	two days without my seroquel… i feel like death, seriously
1	the cipro in you eyes burns but works its buffered for your ears seems stupid but if they take your life take it back

1	thank god i was born with so much hair; i wouldn't been bald by now.

1	lunesta has the most disgusting after taste what the fuck, am i eating pennies jfc
1	omeprazole is what i take and has done me well. dexilant messed me up.
1	it is totally stupid withdrawing from temazepam has been awful &amp; i'm only

1	i love this effer! majorly kills my libido.
1	i tried humira didn't work for my crohn's, infliximab has been a god send, also helps my ankylosing spondylitis
1	products will be any medical or hospital bills related to the injury caused by the product, my husband was permanently injured by avandia
1	hey guys don't forget to refill your paxil for like six days because the withdrawal is like heroin. literally.
1	he said usually ppl taper off effer, bc it’s a rough one to stop, but since i was starting viibryd i should be ok.
1	i might have gained lbs in weeks on zyprexa...haven't lost that weight yet, and it's been years now. call doc if it happens to you.
1	popped a vyvanse i'm tweak. whoop
1	my body is so not ready for this seroquel. never had an antidepressant knock me the fuck out at a quarter dose before o _o
1	i can stay up later with less geodon and less zoloft but then i can't fall asleep and want to stay in bed all day. this has been my week
1	so i've been on metformin now for days (for my newly diagnosed diabetes)... man it's knocking the crap out of me.
1	i appreciate it. i gained over lbs with paxil so i'm trying something different, tired of the appetite side effects.
1	pristiq somehow doesn't make me less horny, but when i gain weight it's only in gut so i can't do that
1	5 day rivaroxaban diary. lower back ache, neck ache, hips and knees ache, short of breath, (am asthmatic) taken paracetamol, to bed.
1	then the viibryd it will be the hardest. makes you very ill. hospital ill.
1	they got salvia, i think it mixed with my neurontin (prescribed to me for rls) and then it just set off a panic attack.
1	it all might be due to restlessness. did make my legs go too!!
1	"""a slimming coffee that could give serious side effects because it contains the active sibutramine substance"""
1	i reaaaallly need to take my paxil but it makes me feel so delirious and just messed up.
1	ah yeah some strong pain meds are hard on the stomach.. cipro is good shit....i thought you had a reaction to it awhile back
1	not hungry but eating anyway. thank you quetiapine you utter cunt.
1	whilst most kids ask santa for xmas presents, i'm like, can we reduce my quetiapine intake, i need to get out of bed
1	i'm not sure if excedrin is the right way for me to go for my tmj headaches. vyvanse + caffeine is pretty rough. ideas?
1	jalapeño cheddar cheetos and a coke to chase my adderall so i don't vom.
1	have any of you developed hives after tysabri infusions ?
1	why is it that people take gabapentin for recreational use. dose increase is making me hyperactive. will have clean house but broken body!
1	okay, can't take lunesta now and get up on time so please mellow me out and get sleepy ms. xanax. gotta be able to be fun and loud tomorrow!
1	little did i know that i would go through withdrawals when coming off of effer xr.
1	so i took a adderall last night...i'm still awake.
1	rt : the day after humira used to be a great one, full of energy, low pain. after a month, it is now a fatigue filled achy day. …
1	i have got to stop taking my vyvanse so late!!
1	ventolin makes me shake
1	ambien mg qhs, nortriptyline mg qhs, fluphenazine mg qhs, and viibryd mg daily and we're wondering why so somnolent? yeesh.
1	i can't even fucking restrict anymore. i just eat, and eat. maybe it's bc of the zyprexa. the other med should help with that, but idk.
1	this new medication is kicking my ass. and i feel flushed. hope i make it through the night. restoril is not playing around
1	a lot of the time coming off adderall makes me feel like i have done molly a day or two ago.
1	nicotine withdrawals.
1	no more ssri’s for me. they kept giving me manic reactions, usually angry. the seroquel has me feeling too tired. it’s brutal
1	i haven't eaten since noon sunday adderall is a hell of a drug
1	am on mg quetiapine. mainly tiredness it causes with me.
1	yeah girl i got a kidney stone so i'm taking oxycodone its knocking my ass out!
1	"when i had my infected k stone, hospital put me on cipro - a synthetic antibiotic. i ""smelled"" a pungent solvent odor, i smell it now. why?"
1	prednisone is slowly killing me slowly. humira got me sicker. remicade stopped working
1	my daughter reckoned she had it, i think it was the tamiflu tabs that made her ill, really bad for wks
1	vyvanse literally causes me to get like schizophrenia but i hear answers idk but i like it
1	the albuterol making me sleepy
1	that lyrica works!! but it scares me that i can't feel anything good or bad! i stopped taking it. i take cymbalta and celebrex
1	liquid oxycodone got me feelin woozie!
1	seroquel gives me nightmares every fucking night but i take it anyway
1	hi i was taken enbrel for months but i had to stop it i was getting bad side effects
1	i've had to reduce the quetiapine back to mg. couldn't take the increased gastro pain. was crumpled in a heap crying x
1	fluoxetine and quet combo zombified me...ah, the meds merrygoround
1	i feel your pain, im allergic to penicillin, ammoxicillin, levaquin, doxycycline. it sucks
1	so, i lasted days on seroquel. i couldn't handle the awful side effects. constantly dizzy and lightheadeded &amp; a myriad of other bad stuff
1	upped my effer dosage days ago. sleep cycle and quality went to shit days ago. i sense a correlation here...
1	withdrawal effects of pregabalin going from bad to worse. going to be a tough few days.
1	im like sweating. i think the adderall i working.
1	effer dreams, now with lucidity. i grant the power of flight?
1	i took tamiflu and since then i've eerienced skin allergic reactions throughout my body and haven't felt the same. is it safe?
1	nicotine is literally poison. but sometimes you gotta find out the hard way.
1	i'm loosing so much blood right now. humira is some scurry ish.
1	are these thoughts my own.... this is your brain on shafer subone twitter fueled freakout
1	ventolin makes me so weak holy shit
1	i think my lunesta forgot how to work
1	will still be on the geodon, but will also be taking a low-dose alprazolam as needed for the sudden anxiety attacks ive been getting
1	levaquin poisoned me and ruined my life! constant pain /7! i hate you, levaquin!
1	so it seems that if i take in am i am drowsy all day. if i take in pm i don’t sleep well. go figure.
1	i'm on the twitter-machine tonight cuz can't walk or do anything else tonight. boosted neurontin dose has my motor control jacked up. :-|
1	. oh. yeah, what kindke said: almost ~100% of metformin users report diarrhea, nausea, vomiting... probably dysbiosis
1	i havent eaten anything all day and im hungry but i dont feel like eating thanks adderall
1	venlafaxine hangover finally starting to shift after huge mugs of hot water with giant pieces of lemon...
1	subone withdrawals
1	tired after the tysabri infusion? i am...
1	i ain't trying to take this seroquel yet. i'm not ready to be sedated and completely unconscious till tomorrow.
1	ugh, lunesta has the worst aftertaste ever. forgot to use my peppermint oil tonight. =.(
1	wondering if tamiflu could make one not sleep. me and mom cannot sleep.
1	oof, sympathies. i had a raging cipro headache last week.
1	paroxetine, may make it hard to have an orgasm.
1	starvation with a side of adderall
1	5 day rivaroxaban diary strange muscle spasms especially in neck shoulders and legs. no more fluid retention. more mobile.
1	side affects of this withdrawal contains confusion, deliriousness, nauesousness and insomnia
1	sorry to hear that. i was on humira for yrs, now remicade for mo. we must shake this fatigue!
1	taking mg of saphris last night was the most monumentally stupid idea ever. i didn't sleep until 0am and the day is a write off
1	i'm high off this tamiflu rn i'm telling you
1	i gained pounds when i wasnt on anything. got on metformin and lost it in three months
1	the will stem from paxil w/d symptoms. mark my words.
1	i was one of them-given levaquin for sinus infec. -reaction-drs. do not take serious enough and now disabled for yrs. please
1	"aciphex is product pronounced ""ass-effects"" &amp; whose possible side-effects include gas, infection &amp; constipation. that cracks me up"
1	already has a higher risk of blood clots than other hormonal smoking &amp; being overweight add more risks.
1	time to let this seroquel take me into some weird dimension and see crazy shit in my dreams. i was getting shot at by gangstas last night
1	important counselling point for sildenafil - swallow tablet with a full glass of water quickly as it may cause a stiff neck
1	pregabalin has made me twitch and have little muscle spasms, it has reduced pain but i think my twitch is drawing attention
1	shouldn't have taken ventolin last night... can't move well
1	pop a trazodone i have fuckin dry mouth
1	cymbalta switch is part of what made me flip. but any snri with family hx of mania puts you at risk.
1	seroquel and alcohol don't mix&gt;&gt; hard to keep my head up haha
1	medicines like tamoxifen and raloxifene are used to treat but can increase .
1	oh yep! the only trouble with seroquel for me is i don't want to get up in the morning. i've always been an early riser.
1	i developed lupus w/remicade, was bedbound on humira and severe allergic reaction to cimzia
1	adderall can actually keep me awake for days on end without an hour of sleep at all , and i hate that.
1	god i'd like to go to sleep right now. but i'm still a little afraid of the visions, even though i stopped taking viibryd days ago.
1	i think the lunesta is interacting with the vyvanse because i am definitely drilling a mint
1	dear seizure buddies, never ever take vimpat. side effects &amp; withdrawals are quite fucking hideous. love, meh
1	feeling better and much less anxious (i could actually talk to people yesterday) but the fluoxetine makes me sooooo sleepy...
1	bigged you up to the wife last night, whilst tipsy on diclofenac
1	derek connolly on statins: atorvastatin can cause bad dreams, suggest that patients take by day &amp; not at night = helps good
1	uncontrollable tremors in hands and legs. body would rock all the time. restlessness. desperation.
1	sorry u lost ur loved one to medication related anaphylaxis. my mother was vioxx casualty. went from looking vibrant to grave
1	i have metformin tummy today
1	i know my stress level is high when my lunesta doesn't even work. day three of very little sleep.
1	my enbrel likes to marvin gaye. i think that is fart. i just went to the diarrhea hut and babysat some dentists.
1	*gets addicted to metformin (it gives u the poops)*
1	high off tramadol and venlafaxine in school omg help i'm falling asleep here
1	took baclofen mg &amp; ibuprofen mg &amp; now i'm laying flat on my back.
1	bah . i remember! . paroxetine was what did that to me... and increased my symptoms ten-fold -_-.
1	good. i'm afraid to use my advair since the thrush infection
1	also told me i was imagining agitation from lyrica because she hasn't heard anyone say it.it's common effect
1	another note to my future self: diclofenac works wonders. be careful not to burn your arm (you won't feel anything anymore) like i just did.
1	do any of my friends who take pristiq have problems with nausea? ):
1	also so glad they gave me percocets instead of t3s. oxycodone helps so much more than codeine. inb4 opiate withdrawels though.
1	i was so excited to go see animals and hang with my friend and his son but i can't stop puking. fucking subone
1	since vioxx killed my mother highly suggest persons who notice change in loved one, friend, anyone investigate adverse reactions.
1	someones said can happen while fighting infection which is quite possible,nearly finished some cipro&amp;bringing up foul gunk!
1	pristiq gave me sexual side effects but celexa's fine, and if i gain lbs it'll be all ass, i've been there lol
1	hot flashes won't be around forever; but weaning of paroxetine could be a nightmare
1	rt : hungover shakes + vyvanse shakes + coffee = recipe for success
1	getting off seroquel (sero-kill) can cause convulsions, fever, toxic reactions, psychotic reactions. and other shit
1	going back to bed for a nap. seroquel has turned me into a zombie again today.
1	my mind races when i'm on a vyvanse
1	"but still dr. maria jasinskas was right &amp; would have been if not for pharmacy; she said, ""you know sometimes vyvanse can make you depressed"""
1	cause ucd sayed i had huntington's disease for like yrs, then said high dose zyprexa caused a false diagnosis. i think i have
1	i can't sleep thanks pristiq
1	count kum hai, can't avoid it being a nicotine addict. :/
1	quetiapine side affects are increased appetite and cravings. it all makes sense.
1	anyway, i was just feeling itchy and my neck was red so they gave me benedryl with my . might be a coincidence but just in case
1	symbicort never fails at giving me heart palpitations to the point where i think i'm about to have a cardiac arrest.
1	i'm good been on mg mtx for years then switched to leflunomide back mtx the other caused tummy trouble. why r u off enbrel
1	all nighter is killing me right now, i hate you vyvanse
1	what was it like? i have teriflunomide mg tablet, called aubagio. my hair falls off. i have been eating this months.
1	found out that diclofenac i took today is q painkiller u get for cancer and post operations. holy shit. nae wunner i was tuned to the moon
1	today was hard - arguing with a professional. was told seroquel doesn’t make you put on weight - i and my extra kg beg to differ.
1	pre subone i could cum like times a day no joke but i'll trade a lifetime of orgasms to never touch heroin again
1	humira was the last drug i tried, did absolutely nothing. doctors have no faith that remicade will be my solution, but i have to try?!
1	desvenlafaxine makes you lose weight though because you can't eat anything on it, it's killer. but it's been keeping me saner.
1	oxycodone put me to sleep this whole week
1	damn you seroquel! why you only let me sleep four hours!?!?
1	this paxil makes me pee so often omg
1	rt : since quetiapine's messed with my prolactin levels, making my boobs humungous &amp; my bras so eensive, i want a lingerie…
1	pretty sure the quetiapine was affecting my sense of taste
1	taking my adderall at in the afternoon was not one of my best decisions.
1	not taking gabapentin tonight, see if i feel less zombie like tomorrow. nothing is worth the brain cloud and lack of coordination.
1	hi i was on humira for months worked great until i got sick last week. don't know if i will go back on it or not.
1	is anyone else out there on latuda and have trouble sleeping?
1	thanks. there is a nonzero chance that the discomfort i am feeling was caused by going back on cymbalta, possibly too quickly.
1	problems sleeping due to mdm asthma &amp; mr ventolin is not helping much..shud hv done d nebulizer..haiz..
1	i lost pounds on vyvanse &amp; that's why life is wonderful
1	psssh didn't levaquin make u hallucinate? girl u best stay away from shrooms lol
1	adderall refills in one day thanks for not asking about the first two insurance..
1	a when it happens to me: sit up or sleep sitting up after taking seroquel to sleep. plus vomiting. feel better
1	it's like i've been drinking all day.. except, there's no pissing with ventolin
1	year old logic + tamiflu rare side effects of hallucinations = weird night.
1	me too. major fatness since i started on the fabulous, non-soporific, weight-gaining quetiapine. it has to go or i will die.
1	i've had cipro before. luckily for me, the only side fx i tend to get from ab is gastic upset. but i rarely use ab.
1	was in enbrel for years until it stopped working
1	the moment i realized my nose is irritated because i took loperamide instead of loratidine.
1	this vyvanse got me sweating right now and i dont even know why
1	i rilly want to get off cymbalta but i don't want to suffer through terrible withdrawals
1	mg of adderall in hours. monsters in hours. half a water bottle. no food. aced my fucking wh final. and haven't slept in hours.
1	do i look brave enough to refuse medication that has side effects i don't want? i have before. symbicort causes osteoporosis.
1	coming off lamotrigine has been as bad as going up on it. poorly tummy, tiredness, feeling disconnected
1	i found the humira to fix all my crohn's issues, but cause other issues. i went off it due to issues w nerves/muscle spasms
1	been in the bathroom since :30am. must be stomach bug. even imodium hasn't helped.
1	i am pretty clumsy and pregabalin makes me clumsier but this door injury was own fault..
1	my mom gave me oxycodone for my cramps and i am pretty sure that i am like high or something lmao. weeeeeeeeeeeee!
1	i am so tired right now. like i feel like i used to when i used to take seroquel and lithium. i haven't been this tired naturally ever
1	i had a weird rash w/ enbrel. but it was all over my abdomen &amp; chest. rash in elbow cld b psoriasis? can u take a pic?
1	vyvanse got me up like zombies.. xan's put me down, them bitches call me romney.. the way i steady clown
1	is mtx called methotrexate ? if so i was on that pill but it didn't help. she wants me on humira or enbrel etc. but not now
1	consider nuvaring or orthomicronor (the mini pill) bc they both cause less weight gain!
1	it was elained to me that all the anti-tnfs can bring out other issues. i had severe joint pain on humira &amp; remicaid
1	hi i'm using enbrel too but it didn't work
1	i take pristiq and i have headache do you think of it?
1	i don't know if vyvanse was a good idea
1	remicade didn't work for me. humira is working (thankfully) so i have to say humira is better
1	oh god the only ventolin i have is the generic brand that has the flavouring that makes me puke. shit.
1	first time i've had the ventolin shakes for years. lolbronchitis.
1	wow i fucking hate the saphris so much it tastes so nasty and makes my mouth numb
1	it's am and still no sleep fuck you vyvanse
1	i clock in at stone (added stone since quetiapine) and according to that bmi thing i'm obese, which i'm clearly not.
1	cipro is real bad on your entire body! take it from me (on disability since '09 thanks to just pills).
1	i have issues with heat exhaustion and sun stroke on enbrel now! sucks at the beach, get really sick so glad you dont!
1	i feel like the kids from 'a nightmare on elm street' i need sleep. the lunesta shit doesn't work for me. can i have ambien again?
1	thank god it is finally get cooler in london. i have been melting all day! i wonder if my medication reduces my tolerance to heat?
1	my enbrel shots hurt a lot less than my back but i still dread them. my brain makes no sense. lol.
1	so anyway last night.. my new medication (venlafaxine/effer) made me feel the most depressed ever, and i overreacted about everything
1	subone is making me gain weight. it sucks. did u gain weight? just curious
1	some day i should try fluoxetine again. it made me all suicidal the first time, but i was
1	"i'm as sick of writing my ""can't sleep"" tweets as y'all are of reading them. trust me. lunesta at :30. it's and not even a yawn."
1	i used to be on paxil but that made me more depressed and prozac made me angry
1	i started prozac a few hours ago and the only side effect i've had was some dizziness. much better than viibryd which had me puking.
1	i hated effer. it makes you hungry, dizzy, and lethargic. that culminated in a large weight gain for me.
1	i'm on enbrel (1 year) but my as is getting worse and my psa is x worse than months ago. eekk! im only , diagnosed yr
1	being sick every morning is getting really old. not sure if anxiety or my body getting used to paxil. anyone know?

1	guess i'm allergic to cipro...
1	dizzy, out if it and confused on the drugs. upping the baclofen slowly now as i seem better on these.
1	ran on an antibiotic this morning (having missed days) and my legs ache like hell, not jsut the soft tissue either. levofloxacin is awful!
1	not winking at you mr. barista, i just way overdid it with the espresso shots &amp; adderall today
1	so damn sleepy. this seroquel is fucking me up so bad.
1	the seroquel the doc gave me, makes doing things difficult. . . but if i don't do something, i'll fall asleep. the catch-22 of crazy.
1	so far so good. i was on remicade for years then had a bad reaction. just started humira
1	i’ll tell ya…. metformin sucks.
1	for the first time in ages i've taken gabapentin and paracetamol. i'm sore and i'm emotional... don't mess with me.

1	can reducing fluoxetine zap me of all energy?i've reduced from a high dose, now on standard does &amp; not feeling good at all.
1	venlafaxine withdrawal is worse than most by miles x
1	that's the hardest part: difficult to willingly self-inflict pain.
1	yeah so does mine, but mine recommended aubagio bc it has fewer side effects. i'm all about the side effects.namely diarrhea lol
1	alendronate is an important cause of pill esophagitis, in osteoporosis give raloxifene instead.
1	crestor causes diabetes....google it.....
1	yeah when i take vyvanse any food just looks/sounds/tastes fucking disgusting
1	humira is the only treatment thats been effective in bringing about and maintaining remission. didn't respond to infliximab!
1	rt : never take your vyvanse at fucking pm...
1	oh, and if you have fillings, consider prescription strength toothpaste - mucodyne &amp; tiotropium both reduce dental defences.
1	i take olanzapine and have a permanent dry mouth what can i do to help it
1	i couldn't take lamictal week into it i got the rash.a rush trip to the er.6 months till rash was gone.
1	i agree that the after sting is much worse from than
1	no, digoxin is the right answer. because ranolazine cause hypotension
1	i think i'm that too! had rare breastmilk production on quetiapine, ultra rare hallucinations (not psychosis) on valproate.
1	best of luck man! and they do suck :/ i was on olanzapine (abilify didnt work)...was awful, gained stone. off it nw n doin gud!
1	mri done of legs, hope the effects of levaquin are not permanent, is not improving. be aware of rx fluoroquinolone type side effects

1	no one likes me on my vyvanse
1	remicade has also made me throw up before, but humira has only made me really nauseous but no vomiting
1	metformin has made me very ill for a very long time. it feels good to be alive and not taking that fucking poison

1	why was gardasil fast-tracked after vioxx had killed +k &amp; k heart attacks and strokes? where was the hpv fire?
1	restless leg syndrome is bad tonight. damn you fluoxetine.
1	since starting metformin i can honestly compare myself to a possum that's dead on the pavement in the middle of summer. i am that bloated.
1	i hope buscopan works.... since loperamide and the other one didn't
1	minus the skin reactions, this week i can say i think enbrel is helping

1	i've heard a lot about tummy problems and metformin
1	so, my pregabalin was supposed to be being increased...but is now being decreased due to horrible dry eyes and mouth side effect.
1	hungover shakes + vyvanse shakes + coffee = recipe for success
1	i am still laughing. this is what weaning off of paxil and being a moron does to you.

1	i'm still awake because apparently even lunesta can't take me out. but in reality ---- that's me dying from sleep deprivation.

1	i can't take this i thought having seroquel would make it easier but nope. my whole body feels like i have raw nerve endings going crazy
1	5 rivaroxaban diary day . aches easing, back pain easing. swollen lower legs like fluid retention. i take mg. furosemide every a.m.
1	i will but the flow vent and advair helps so much they make you so shaky.
1	hmm, interesting. i may have been undergoing baclofen withdrawal hence the anxiety for the past few months…
1	i've heard of all kinds of skin issues on lamictal! pretty sure mine is psychosomatic though...
1	where are y'all. good grief! i didn't even get one reply... discrimination! guess my parents don't matter. vioxx killed mom.
1	my house smells of bacon &amp; seroquel is making me so hungry i want to tear my own face off &amp; eat it or cry or maybe both at once.
1	i loved fluoxetine (prozac) but it made me lose my temper of the slightest thing but that was the only downside.
1	pros and cons of medication. dilemma: have been taking oxybutynin for hyperhidrosis. works very well, but drys out eyes &amp; mouth severely.
1	who needs sleeping pills you've just gotta take puffs each of advair and ventolin
1	so apparently mgs of prozac will make you scared of eating gmo's and make you think you need to save the world! switching back to mgs!!!
1	paxil didn't end up helping. tried prozac and wellbutrin and it helped my mood and anxiety but gave me vertigo.
1	olanzapine is amazing srsly, the dreams are immense, no addiction, its gorgeous, like brave new world soma to me
1	anyway for the nausea in meantime sipped some plus and it is better. mightnt be gastric related then, just sympathetic response fr lyrica
1	my breath smells awful (thanks vyvanse) anyone have gum
1	frustrated! cannot figure out what is wrong w/these pattern pieces &amp; why can't get them to line up correctly! stupid gabapentin

1	vimpat gives me crazy double vision, too. that reminds me... medicine time!
1	weird thing about paxil: feeling fully awake and energized and feeling completely tired and half-asleep at the same time.
1	why does lunesta ruin everything i eat or drink tastewise?
1	my friends are annoying me and i'm having withdrawls from the paxil because american healthcare is a joke
1	just had the most disturbing dream ever. note to self: don't take a nap when you took a lunesta the night before

1	kinda worried about the nighttime jaw clenching from effer, what with my tongue ring and all... :l

1	me too. i am more or less fine on my periods then nuvaring just made me a total mess the first month. it cooled down tho.

1	i'm taking mg pregablin and mg duloxetine hence why i'm totally mashed

1	i used to dream every night without fail on fluoxetine...i have no crazy stories each morning now i'm off it though!! :-l
1	only neg side effect i get from gabapentin is drowsiness; doesn't work great for pain, but strangely, it's more effective for

1	coming off mg venlafaxine over days was a better idea in discussion. my brain feels like its actually vibrating!
1	oooh. lightheaded today. switching meds, it's been a few days without pristiq (the one i'm going off of) - withdrawals are fun.

1	like, adderall butchered my ability to concentrate and made me angry all the time while strattera was almost perfect for me.
1	what meds are you on? gabapentin /pregablin =horrible weight gain. opiates can cause very bad nausea /stomach pains /vomiting...

1	yeah i feel you lol i’ve heard some stories. darvocet will knock you out too
1	for anxiety to penetrate through my drowsy haze (a result of the triumvirate of fluoxetine, pregabalin, amoxicillin?) is pretty good going.
1	i had been blaming my dizziness upon standing to my menopause but now on hrt &amp; no more flashes so looked at cymbalta side effs
1	when they had me on risperdal, paxil, lunesta &amp; xanax, i couldn't feel a god-damn thing emotionally, i hated that. i'm an anti-drug activist
1	damn, i'm so proud of you!! i'm still limping from the levaquin cure for my pneumonia that dissolved left knee cartilage...
1	so unfair, i never get the good side effects of meds. ativan, seroquel, &amp; ambien xr make me feel so drink i cant really walk &amp; im nauseated

1	permanent side effect: happened to me after using darvocet after a series of many knee surgeries. that's how i know.
1	the effer dreams have taken a terrifying turn. ugh.
1	thinking it might be the baclofen doing it.only on a low dose though.broken sleep is a nightmare.
1	the humira helps me. i took remicade before that, but it stopped being effective. i'm a fan of humira.
1	mri showed lesions in my noggin got to have eeg to see if its ms or humira doing it.so more tests n messing about lolxx
1	why couldn't you get addicted to cialis. then i could call you cialis connor. adderall conner doesn't sound cool.
1	do you know how badly i want a cigarette right now? but no. i manfully suffer through nicotine withdrawal—all for you
1	that's good news. you must feel a bit less stressed. btw, are you ok with diazepam and fluoxetine? take both and they space me out

1	the comedown on adderall is so fucking annoying
1	one of my brothers is addicted to subone &amp; it terrifies me that it could kill him my whole family is on drugs or alcoholics
1	i'm already taking enbrel but it's annoying and a bitch. if i don't take anything i won't be able to walk..so it's not an option
1	oxycontin is a long acting oxycodone product that can cause constipation

1	hey gurrrl, it might just be the januvia talking but i have severe abdominal pain that may be severe pancreatitis and lead to death.
1	"""do you have any medication allergies?"" ""asthma!!!"" me: ""........"" pt: ""no wait. avelox, that's it!"" ""so no other allergies?"" ""right!"" *cont"
1	cipro destroyed my entire body, from head to toe. bedridden since . be very careful.
1	i was literally on percocet darvacet motrin and vicodin. nothing. made it better. nothing.
1	they've got him on fucking subone but he's acting like he's on coke
1	zoloft was just as bad as effer. it made me more depressed and more suicidal. i don't want it.
1	i still get the pins &amp; needles feeling in my hands since doing humira
1	the only bad thing about vyvanse is the awful headache you get when it's starting to wear off
1	rocephin + ciprofloxacin = me barely able to stay awake
1	if you want to sleep for + hours, take seroquel. fuck i just woke up and it's
1	pain mess don't work i take mg oxycodone every hours plus lots of neurontin and valium and ativan it all does nothing
1	i take qvar x a day. singulair gave me nightmares and advair made weird things grow out my skin, itching burning too :-/
1	a nightmare on lunesta
1	but they had to take me off geodon cuz i was developing tardive dyskonesia
1	have run out of olanzapine, was tapering off anyway but this is a bit too quick-feel restless. hot bath and diazepam time
1	i can’t see the point in taking it’s screwing up my sleep &amp; i’m pretty sure it’s not helping with the depression.
1	my chest is so heavy and ventolin isn't getting to it and i'm freaking outtttt
1	whenever i use my ventolin lately i shake i hate it i also hate that i haven't had to use it for like yrs and now im using it almost daily
1	yesh. i tried lunesta and ambien. ambien was a joke. lunesta made my mouth taste like battery acid
1	popped a fluoxetine im sweating
1	i hate how vyvanse makes me over think everything and it makes me angry about things that i shouldn't even be angry about
1	i've had a lovely, relaxing day, but end it weighed down by nonspecific foreboding and crushing sense of guilt
1	i took lunesta because i'm out of my meds. and this taste in my mouth.
1	it's very tough. i understand, &amp; you have my full sympathy. how did you find cymbalta withdrawals?
1	venlafaxine withdrawal is horrific
1	this oxycodone got me feeling goodddd... shit dangerous
1	metformin still makes me want to puke after all this time
1	prescription drug abuse looks like adderall and sometimes but rarely vicodin where i live
1	""": then again. i haven't slept in hours so that probably has a little something to do with it"" adderall got him like"
1	had something of a creative day around my pain and gabapentin wooziness and headache. sewing morning, painting afternoon, evening reading.
1	soooo i wore gray yogas &amp;took an adderall &amp;left my book bag at home. so what if my ass sweats. now what's gonna hide it?? shoulda wore black
1	ugh, maybe tamiflu isn't the greatest thing after all. it can cause insomnia and anxiety.
1	ain't nothing worse than having vasovagal pre-syncope from levaquin toxicity. hard to digest food just pushes all the nerves.
1	ugh adderall always puts me in a daze.. i'm sleepy but tired enough to sleep
1	latuda is really taking a toll on me, i've never been this tense. maybe it has to do with the healing meditation last night.
1	woohoo! back on singulair &amp; advair cos of my allergies. i refuse to end up back in the hospital because of the asthma probs they trigger
1	rt : vyvanse makes me think too much
1	dear alternative medicine aficionados, don't do intra-nasal acupuncture when you're on effient and aspirin.
1	not that i ever noticed. i was taking it with venlafaxine, and it definitely made me drowsy
1	one of the things i hate most about quetiapine is when i take it for the first few hours i slur my words, so people assume i'm merely drunk.
1	restless arms &amp; legs! blood quetiapine :-/
1	hi chris, try diclofenac ,30mg, times daily, best anti-inflammatory gives great pain relief, but you need to take omeprazole
1	who need alcohol when you have gabapentin and tramadol that makes you feel drunk at oclock
1	do not use miralax brand laxatives !!!!! i tried and i am still full the brim with the devil's brownies. does not work.
1	i find the baclofen worse, it has left me in a tired/sleepy fog all day - the codeine i can (mostly) deal with.
1	oxycodone just makes me ears rumble and does like nothing else
1	you know starting with geodon, the meds messed up my attitude. how odd. it's not just about spirituality. i became a bit mean. that got
1	so that would elain the bronchitis.... it may not be an allergy, but the effects of using advair over a long period of time
1	been thailand so many time it's lovely but always seem to have bad dreams every since i been on quetiapine x
1	but yeah, that geodon totally fucked me up and i became a pain as a result. a whiny pain i'll add but it was also druggies and some white
1	i hate saphris so much it's the worst thing i've ever been prescribed. fuck it makes my head hurt so much &amp; my mouth goes numb.
1	every time i forget seroquel, i end up rage breaking things eg- my laptop *facepalm*
1	i tried subone twice... had a weird reaction to it both times. va dr sent me to clinic.
1	i have some seriously disturbing dreams. thanks thanks a freaking lot. well i guess it's better than being ..only just
1	.sevenkg. not good at all. seroquel will do it's best to make those numbers bigger so now i have to really watch what i eat.
1	packing whilst eeriencing venlafaxine withdrawal is pretty hellish. got to keep track of my med times.
1	been dealing with some not so lovely side effects from the metformin lately. the constant lingering threat of digestive upset is not fun.
1	seriously, when i get a man i'm gonna have to take my nuvaring out, i never even think about sex but with the pills
1	humira didn't work for me but the remicade (infleximaub) was awesome. good luck. i did great!
1	co-codemol and trazodone have taken control of my eyes, so i better go to bed, before they switch off my legs too, g'nite all, stay safe
1	great.. i have hives up and down my legs from this gosh dang trazodone
1	the consumers and or their families who get hurt by avandia such as permanent injury or death is paid by the consumer and or the estate of
1	going through a real bad nicotine withdraw...
1	viibryd - hey, gayle. that stuff sounds awful. especially the memory things, or at least that's what w...
1	i recently stopped taking effer what can i do to ease my withdrawls?i feel miserable right now and very angry.please any ideas
1	i have a life appointment tomorrow, and i'm going to cry to her about lamictal. because it makes everything worse. i hate medication.
1	aubagio - been on it for days; have eerienced hand/feet peeling (very dry skin).
1	does trazodone actually make people feel like high omfg it makes me sleepy
1	i know. i just realised with everything else - i haven't taken the sodding quetiapine yet!! wondered why i wasn't drowsy doh!
1	i started out with lyrica but i could no longer afford it &amp; it made me bloated. tried cymbalta &amp; my heart was beating wicked fast
1	weird how i have a high alcohol tolerance but don't brag about that the way i brag about imodium having absolutely no effect on me (ladies)
1	tysabri helped with my flares but killed my immune system. haven't had side effects from aubagio ++++
1	enbrel is a miracle but it made my eyes worse so couldn't have it anymore
1	lol no. adderall only makes me emotional, no physical pain.
1	oh. delayed reaction from humira injections-my hip joints just started hurting. haha.
1	i'm reducing duloxitine (been on yr) and slowly increasing m but slept -14 hrs solid and still feel wasted
1	lunesta is hours of miserable sleep and nothing like the fascinating well funded ad campaign.
1	not addictive? 'ssri discontinuation syndrome.' i know someone who has been trying to come off venlafaxine for over two years &gt;
1	i have suffered severe reaction to infliximab after th one so had to stop. humira is next step in uk
1	your lucky! i have to do infusions of remicade for my ra. i would happily do humera or enbrel if it didnt make me stop breathin
1	only problem is i'm hungry. seroquel nation hunger
1	my parents had to pick between remicade or humira. plus my docs added methotrexate. both remicade &amp; humira failed.
1	my favourite things about fluoxetine are: it doesnt work as an antidepressant. increases suicidal thoughts. it stops you from jizzing.
1	holy shit no more xanax or risperidone. i will have withdrawals. still on viibryd but it's next. it makes me the sickest.
1	another night of ‘light’ sleep. feel low. subdued. sad.
1	not going to take my latuda til tonight. that stuff's gon' make me pass the hell out within minutes, &amp; i wanna watch me some !
1	pah. meh-ness + pregabalin drowsiness &amp; dizziness is making me sloth-like. i've not been able to read a book for weeks. not a good sign.
1	pre loaded and not as fun to inject as enbrel sure click but doesn't kill my immune system as bad &amp; helps my intestinal issues
1	. at last, a good side effect. couldn't go back on seroquel due to diabetes risk.
1	i better go to bed.. effer withdrawal makes me feel kinda terrible ugh.
1	i changed from rebif to tecfidera in november. i've done well so far. no flu like symptoms anymore, like after shot day!
1	allergic reaction to . feel free to share &amp; distribute. kill before it kills us.
1	wow, the rls is out of control tonight does anyone out there taking seroquel have issues with restless leg syndrome?
1	oh yuck. we all have our least favorite body fluid. mine is aerosolized blood. nosebleed on xarelto -eeeew
1	not even taking my adderall is helping me concentrate on my career counseling reading.
1	"""no taste for you"" -vyvanse"
1	i took a oxycodone for my headache i went smck to sleep
1	mates anyone have a delayed (2days)reaction of hives in response to enbrel after taking it for awhile? and not at the injection site
1	wondered why my limbs ached and i was shivering on the hottest day of the year so far. forgot my venlafaxine. that'll be withdrawal then!
1	i hate quetiapine. i was so relieved to come off it and stop feeling like a zombie.
1	understand why my specialists told me to but big bags of mints when taking gabapentin driest mouth every and drinks don't help it

1	lalalalala.. clearly i've underestimated my vyvanse by choosing to take it in the middle of the day.
1	im delaying on taking my geodon so i can stay up late
1	vyvanse and seroquel
1	i'm taking tamiflu and feel like i'm gonna throw up all the time
1	has anyone tried the humira shot, i heard it feels like hot lava going thru your skin for the first seconds but my doctor wants me to get it
1	i tell you gabapentin is making me balk! after the th tablet of the day my gag reflex kicks in...this sucks balls!
1	developing add in my s thanks to the memory/attention-killing lamictal i've been on since my early teens.
1	s th day with still eeriencing some side effects (drowsiness,sleepiness,gi effects). moderate improvement in mood
1	quetiapine - i slept!! weirdo dreams and very drowsy this morning but i slept!!!
1	it's better than some of my old meds which caused, like, mood swings and nightmares and insomnia. my vimpat (the current
1	geez this vyvanse makes me talk a mile a minute haha
1	get well soon, sir. levaquin did a number on my joints a few years back.
1	i'm not allowed to take seroquel &amp; neurontin &amp; then go cook food cause i nod out like i'm on dope &amp; make a fuckin mess whoops hahaha
1	shoot out to this oxycodone for making me high af.
1	ventolin is not working its magic anymore ️️
1	didnt know lamotrigine was addictive stopped as didnt think were helping days of hell before realized, back on now
1	i'm too numb to feel, blow out the candle, blindness
1	still a slightly fast pulse this morning. i know this is the quetiapine
1	conclusion: my psychiatrist is not very attentive and i should be on seroquel, not benzos and the maniatriggering lamitol.
1	thanks am so chuffed, got so big on olanzapine, been working hard for it x
1	samezies it's the lamictal i'm flat as a kate hudson in how to lose a guy in days

1	im on an adderall high atm and im shaking and my heart is pounding fuck
1	metformin is keeping my energy low
1	this adderall finna have me cleaning everything.
1	thank you! ironically, my problem wasn't from diabetes; it was from enbrel that new drug they give to treat ra. lowered my
1	quetiapine. very low dose even with increase. helps me get to sleep (&amp; eat in general) but feel really groggy in the morning

1	first two weeks of olanzapine v drowsy. weight gain was an issue. great for my anxiety though.
1	i'm void of nicotine and my moods are void of stability.
1	effer i found was not so bad. currently on cymbalta &amp;the wdrawals are vile. internet full of horror stories,
1	so it fucking turns out that a side effect of effer is a loss of appetite
1	ssris were great for me for ages, not working as well now. thus seroquel. i’m also on clonazepam, makes me sleepy too.
1	meds work differently for each person. i know seroquel xr was hell for me &amp; i gained weight but can be heaven for another
1	oh, that's all. i remember when they took me off geodon and i slept for three days.
1	as are (probably) the nausea, headache, sweats, flu symptoms &amp; diarrhea. but it’s still better than being on it.
1	humira worked for me much better than remicaid. i felt constantly beat up on r. humira was much easier to administer, too.
1	do i come off my medication or do i just continue to be a prozac zombie
1	well miralax didn't work for me. i think im invincible at this point.
1	i hate cipro!
1	fluoxetine is a hell of a drug if you're into being awake all night and feeling ill.
1	wow paxil sent me into a huge hypo manic mixed episode.

1	that's what i get but the bloody quetiapine made me so bloody miserable.
1	i take asacol every morning. doesn't help toilet much but stops stabbing pains. loperamide helps too.
1	i reckon i have drug-induced oedema causing musculo-skeletal pain. likely drug combination: rivaroxaban, losartan, and simvastatin.
1	another light nights sleep brought to me courtesy of dammit.
1	sildenafil side-effect, lowering of kelvin midpoint in eyesight. tungsten lamp appears white and sky twice as blue.

1	depression hurts cymbalta can... fuck your whole body up inside out so your rainy day doesn't seem so bad... pussy.
1	right now i'm getting by on a low dose of pred and the doc wants me to consider humira since remicade stopped working.
1	tamiflu has a side effect which includes vomiting. i'm not sure that is helping.

1	advair is bad for your bones i hope i don't end up with osteoporosis

1	you are so horny and i am not! wtf!!! paxil why paxil why!!!!
1	recently read that levaquin may cause tendon tears or ruptures. maybe that's why my achilles' are screaming.
1	i suppose the only concern is that the lamotrigine is toxic in fairly low doses but i haven't actually taken an od for months.
1	yeah i know, i dont take my trazadone at night cause it makes me feel groggy in the morning and i wont wake to my alarm):

1	i haven't been diagnosed with pots but i do have orthostatic hypotension which they say is a side effect of namenda

1	i feel your pain. and i tried the ambien and lunesta route but that stuff made me feel stupid.

1	on bbc2 talking about vitamin d, i'm on metformin for type diabetes, that lowers vit d, work shifts so use supplements

1	to be fair, took adderall last week &amp; wrote a paper on socialism. basically blacked out writing it &amp; i think i'm socialist now..
1	i fell asleep at like :00. now i'm wide awake. gabapentin is weird like that. knocks me on my ass.
1	i used to. i'm on humira now. i ended up developing a reaction to remicade.
1	is sucktastic. neuro appt monday to discuss a third med after getting the rash with lamotrigine and the glaucoma with topiramate.
1	i stopped taking my seroquel because i hate it. i can barely function on it, hopefully my cpn &amp; psychiatrist can advise a 'nicer' med.
1	remicade was my last treatment before humira and i really loved it. then i started having a reaction from it multiple times
1	when i forgot seroquel made me feel fucking ill as fuck!
1	the misery i'm eeriencing today from the pain, outweighs the anti-depressant effect of the lamotrigine
1	did you have headaches in between humira shots? any noticeable side effects with remicade?
1	"i watched that movie ""side effects"" while coming off paxil and relapsed"
1	oy.. i'm allergic to paxil. makes me physically puke didn't understand why. i see a psych. i'm on mg of zoloft.
1	your poor love. enbrel made me go crazy and humira has screwed my metabolism, gained lbs &amp; had cronin infections.
1	since swapping my quetiapine doses around, my hunger and cravings have gotten so bad!
1	whenever i take loperamide i feel great that day but always feel awful the following day, anyone else the same?
1	shouldn't have taken mg of vyvanse today...
1	amitriptyline is great at night, but it knocked me out too much. diclofenac is a bit stronger than naproxen
1	my mom took lyrica that the doctor prescribed her &amp; now she's having crazy hallicunations
1	- take a baby aspirin w/the tecfidera or when you eerience side effects like flushing. -4 oz of applesauce w/pill also helps.
1	new meds have me out of it. i want therapy not doping up! i was highly functioning now have trouble standing!
1	diclofenac makes me sick, naproxen makes me depressed and ibuprofen isn't a long term solution.
1	latuda side effects,not only don't want it for ones but, don't want hang out with anyone on it.side effect warnings r like scary movie.
1	so, results of today's scope are pretty abysmal. humira not doing a bloody thing. dr. wants me on remicade asap. i hate this disease.
1	effer was a boner killer, absolutely. welbutrin goes the other way.
1	coming off is harder than u think. nausea sickness hot and cold shivers twitching headache
1	i'm a bit drunk its my prozac
1	take first pristiq tablet for weeks. immediately feel sick.
1	taking gabapentin is proving to be difficult... soo sleepy and hyper at the same time. chronic pain sucks!
1	ok i need help: crohns, full proctocolectomy w ileostomy w reversal remicade not working, so does humira work?
1	i have psoriatic arthritis .. was on enbrel and that stopped working so on humira now for over a year.
1	really bad rls fron seroquel
1	i get my headaches when my humira wears off. my dad is on remicade.
1	finally got my vyvanse today, now i can go back to hating food . ha
1	going to ask the gp for sleeping tablets. tried temazepam before which at least gave me a few nights sleep before it stopped working.
1	it's the enbrel that's causing the flushing and night sweats it's no wonder i feel the need to go roll around in the wet snow.
1	oxycodone got me feelin' some type of way
1	i need to start taking my viibryd again but it makes me feel so nauseous ughhh
1	ty, its nasty. they bleed for ages bcoz i'm on rivaroxaban which is like mega warfarin so don't clot easy. then they ooze 'stuff'!!
1	infliximab worked for only a short time, humira wasn't effective at all, i suffer from crohns and uc. there's only one real cure
1	and it's that horrible time where it's too late to take lunesta or i'd sleep till in the afternoon
1	i'm not taking my meds tonight. i think latuda makes me hallucinate more than normal. i can't deal with it
1	nexium got my stomach all types of fucked up dawg
1	stop taking xarelto immediately if you suddenly start hemorrhaging out of your nostrils. glad i read the fine print
1	i've tried every nsaid going diclofenac didn't ease much, the nerve meds gabapentin etc gave severe side effects xxx
1	0 day rivaroxaban diary. thanks to paracetamol and hot water bottle i had hrs continuous sleep. woke uo with frontal headache, /2
1	last night video chatted me while i was in a lunesta haze. i couldn't see or hear her, but knew she was there. weird
1	all the things i have just make me sleepy as hell: cymbalta, klonopin, ambien. wait what if i take em all togethhssaagg
1	i guess this is what i get for doubling my vyvanse
1	many congratualtions for being able to come off quetiapine - i have read that and clozapine are the worst for withdrawals
1	promethazine with codein, a tessalon pearl &amp; a trazodone. i'm not coughing anymore but i'm even more exhausted.
1	i really hate the fact that i feel like i need to throw up while at work. maybe taking my vyvanse wasn't a good idea
1	i shouldn't tweet on vyvanse it's going to be extremely negative lol
1	interesting posters: ritonavir inhibitis intranasal fluticasone metabolism causing adrenal suppression
1	ugh i hate metformin im sick
1	i should really do somethjng more effient with my time but i need a nap. going to sleep at am &amp; waking up every so often is not fun.
1	i hated seroquel, i was sleeping hrs a day on it
1	the goal is to not get thrush from my symbicort
1	i was on quetiapine and gained lbs &lt;wall&gt; so i am not even trying olanzapine. they gave me abilify cause it not supposed to
1	kind of moot now, imo, bc nobody's giving me sulfa drugs again, or taking me off celebrex or lamictal unless i get the rash back
1	i don't know whether my vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my vyvanse addiction.
1	i'm so fine today. increasing zyprexa,my condisition is became so good. it has a side effect that increase my weight. i must care about it.
1	havent been able to take my neurontin because that combined with all my other meds makes me to tired

1	seroquel was my boner kryptonite when i was a disfunctional teen
1	i have a penicillin/ keflex allergy so my dr writes me days of zpack or i'd still be sick too! sometimes cipro
1	seriously haven't ate one thing all damn day..
1	4 day rivaroxaban diary. atrocious backache despite having taken paracetamol an hour ago. gone back to bed.
1	quetiapine perhaps gives most dramatic effect for single low dose. no, pts are not being lazy in bed hours a day, asleep!
1	i haven’t changed any meds, been on the tramadol &amp; pregabalin for months now. it’s odd! i look like i’ve been in a fight
1	okay i took the seroquel and i am resisting the urge to vomit it up i feel disgusting but oh well good times good vibes don't be sad
1	deciding against taking adderall today because i think i want subway later.
1	synthroid completely kills my energy levels and armour thyroid makes my heart beat rapidly. think i'll just stay in bed all winter
1	almost blew out my arms &amp; heels work. they hurt like hell. &amp; the pain is spreading, damned cipro.
1	i found it worked better for me than quetiapine because it didn't make me as drowsy.
1	metformin got my stomach hurting like shit.
1	rt : vyvanse makes me think too much
1	too much vyvanse.... not sleeping tonight

1	that'll be the quetiapine making you drowsy. it's a common side effect xx
1	wish it was monday...seeing doctor tomorrow &amp; want to see if he has any suggestions for my withdrawal.
1	dear paxil, you're supposed to make me feel better. instead you've wrecked me completely. thanks to you, i had to take an adivan.
1	woo it's so awesome when my adderall makes me have a rapid heart rate when i run so i look like i'm about to have a heart attack
1	the only medication (of which i am aware...and i know almost all of them) that has a regular headache side-effect is lamictal.
1	started with avonex yrs ago then tysabri. allergic so nothing for + yrs now tecfidera
1	rt : maybe it's just a vyvanse addict thing rt : nothing more satisfying than crossing something of…
1	it has nothing to do with any of that~ apparently seroquel makes you gain alot of weight -__-
1	sure is! i no longer even own a car after being crippled by cipro (a bayer product!). who needs a car when you can't walk!?
1	thats the prob with zyprexa its for ppl with bi-polar or schizophrenia its really strong when you wake up your drowsy for hrs

1	&amp; this is what happens right before the seroquel knocks me on my ass. i ramble on &amp; on about shit. lol yay life

1	binge watching upstairs downstairs on netflix. hurrah for enbrel and it's power to lift ridiculous fatigue!
1	5 day rivaroxaban diary. neck ache and right shoulder ache. lower back pain.
1	maybe i'm allergic to paxil, because it didn't say anything about making your face break out.
1	the only thing i hate about adderall is no appetite or sleep
1	i think my tablets have made me gain weight. anyone on fluoxetine/prozac?
1	i am prescibed keppra/levitiricitam and pregabalin high doses but only take pregabalin as keppra drowsy,any alternatives?
1	. synthroid causing freq afib. wht is my alternative?

1	this nuvaring gives me the worst cramps all month long
1	allergic reaction to . feel free to share &amp; distribute. kill before it kills us.
1	i wish i'd have found your article sooner! i was crippled by cipro in oct of '09. prescribed for a uti &amp; it didn't even help.
1	the gabapentin is making me tired and the tramadol is making me light headed. am ok if busy but if not....
1	some inhalers make you shaky and can increase the feeling of anxiety. my flovent tastes like rocks.
1	this lunesta has me feeling half retarded i can't move my body right i think it's time i went to sleep
1	i used to take darvocet for migraine. my only issue with it is if i took more than one dose, violent hiccups.
1	stopped for months as it caused terrible side effect. had to start back up or lose my job r soooo fun
1	crippled since oct of '09 thanks to just cipro pills here...run for your life! tendon rupture is only the tip of the iceberg.
1	benzos don't work for me &amp; i've had a cracker of a panic attack on seroquel. listening to people chat on podcasts helps me.
1	def vicodin lol i'm on oxycodone that shit knocks me tf out i'll be talking then i just pass out lol
1	going in to see 'the one that decides you don't need any meds' doctor. think it's buprenorphine withdrawal. hospital warned weeks.
1	gonna have to speak with my psychiatrist about stopping my olanzapine its interfering with my visions and it gives you memory loss and more.
1	i have been on enbrel, remicade, and simponi. enbrel didn't work well enough for me.
1	i was going to work the legs some today, but viibryd gave me the shits. sooo it's best to avoid that for now.
1	victoza makes me have no appetite at all!!
1	"sildenafil in high doses reported to have caused blindness - no wonder people always say ""love causes blindness"""
1	pregabalin gives me d-cinema vision (without the glasses) - it's unusual seeing the rgb spectrum distort whatever you're looking at.
1	when i did humira for my crohn's it felt like acid, hubby had to shoot me up. made my lupus flare too
1	this quetiapine isn't working damnit!!!! does make me hungry at night though... *sigh*
1	oh hey. much like other anti-convulsants, lamictal dehydrates you. so much is elained.
1	i take metformin because i have to, and it works. but it also makes me unable to tolerate much alcohol, and that part i hate.
1	the day after humira used to be a great one, full of energy, low pain. after a month, it is now a fatigue filled achy day.
1	i've had too much quetiapine today - i'm zombified.
1	-nods- my zombie-ness when i first wake up in the morning is mostly from my nightly meds too (seroquel).
1	took pills of lamictal cause that shit will fuck you up. yo eyes are outta focus and you can't walk straight but your happy as hell.
1	i did it. it hurt quite a bit more this time. but i did it.
1	...my old ones! plus caffeine in the morning counteracts these quite nicely whereas quetiapine hangovers were unshiftable
1	my tolerance for my trazodone goes up every few days
1	i hope i'm making sense i accidently took lunesta and my brain is mush.
1	well i took an adderall so no wonder i can't nap
1	i've taken gabapentin and vicodin. don't eect me to make any sense.
1	vyvanse makes me having the sleeping schedule of a fucking vampire.
1	okay, mg of memantine a day seems to have stopped the worst of the panic attacks. now i just had no motivation. :/
1	i've had ocd symptoms like that for a while but seems like the seroquel exacerbates things and now this. :\
1	didnt take my fluoxetine this morning because i forgot and i've been so shaky and tired all day, is this like, withdrawal symptoms?
1	i take trazodone for my &amp; still have a hard time falling asleep or i end up having crazy dreams that wake me up!?!
1	today's pristiq withdrawal symptom: my eyeballs make a sound like star trek doors when i move them.
1	ooh me too! rt : did not suit me at all. had severe tremors and weight gain.
1	hello, world! quetiapine zombie this morning and i have a work call in about minutes. perfect combination.
1	p.s. the meds w/their sideffects are not good. when i was on lunesta i drank a bottle of peroxide &amp; became violently ill. not fun
1	she and i are both colon free now, so no humira or remicade! they failed miserably at helping us.
1	took too many hits of ventolin this morning and am now remembering why i don't smoke crack anymore
1	rt : almost blew out my arms &amp; heels work. they hurt like hell. &amp; the pain is spreading, damned cipro.
1	it was! supposed to take synthroid but it doesn't help &amp; i'm vit d deficient. so that has a lot to do with it also i think
1	viibryd has given me my life back, but the brain zaps i eerience are so harsh that my entire body jolts, not just my head.
1	when u havent shit since sunday so u have to take miralax twice a day and it doesnt work
1	umm, are you being a smart-ass? dont mess with me right now. going through cymbalta withdrawal i think &amp; im very depressed.
1	boniva would've been better properly named as an erectile dysfunction drug.
1	man i got oxycodone for my wisdom teeth and guess what, it makes me hyper not chill.
1	allergic reaction to . feel free to share &amp; distribute. kill before it kills us.
1	(tw body image) the gabapentin made me put weight on and i've never felt so bad about my own body before. people tell me
1	have to go to a doc now to see why i'm still gaining. stupid paxil made me gain like pounds and now i have to lose it
1	probably a month ago after i started taking the viibryd i began tumbling out of dreams into a half conscious state
1	off my tits on ventolin this morning.
1	thank you! coming off effer is not fun!
1	i took my trazodone like an hour ago and i can barely keep my eyes open and i need to finish homeworrrkkk
1	luckily i had spare keppra and vimpat on me phew! i was given lorazapam for status a few months ago.. lost days of my life!
1	i'm taking dexilant and i'm eeriencing stomach ache and diarrhea via
1	i think i'm gong to speak my gp about reducing quetiapine dosage. the weight gain from it is scaring the hell out of me.
1	allergic to morphine, codeine &amp; tramadol. was okay on buprenorphine tablets but had to come off as block anaesthetic.
1	do u also have a detox for subone because that also becomes addictive and harder to get off then herion
1	vimpat makes me exhaugsted!!
1	sos i havent slept for hours im on adderall i cant scream
1	can't wait til my adderall stops working so that my hands can stop shaking and my eye stops twitching
1	dissociative fugues &amp; loss of empathy since age , serious cardio problems since age , almost dying of paxil withdrawal , that's a-ok
1	enbrel is to help clear your skin. side effects, you ask? tuberculosis, cancers, heart failure, etc.... um, no thanks.
1	(triggering) so... i'm taking quetiapine and tramadol pre-cutting. i'm allergic to tramadol...this should be interesting
1	as an adult i was on adderall along with zoloft and chantix. i was so angry and confused and depressed i couldn’t function.
1	metformin has the potential to cause nausea, loose stools etc. as a potential side effect
1	the placebo week of birth control increases blood levels of lamictal, which in turn makes me a very cheerful insomniac.
1	synthroid will not work for me. i need them to pay for armour
1	negative. rimonabant does not cause reverse effects of marajuana, instead it causes extreme depression, anxiety, joint pains etc
1	my sleep schedule is all fucked up and pristiq is making me gain weight and i don't like this
1	i would not recommend toying around with cipro if you don't have to. did you know it can cripple you for life?
1	i really feel like this fluoxetine is messing with my perspective time and people.
1	i'm feeling weirdly antsy lately and i'm positive it's due to the prozac and i'm a bit worried where that could lead me
1	just took my geodon and i'll be lucky if i'm asleep in hours.
1	nicotine withdrawals
1	half of seroquel knocks me out so fast and im asleep for at least hours...
1	been off synthroid and metformin for a week. i no longer have aches/pains in my shoulders or legs. stopping victoza, going on insulin only.
1	when are you going to do true life: i am addicted to vyvanse?
1	it works otherwise. my pcp started me on trazodone before. i felt like i.had a frontal lobotomy the following day
1	if u r on and have respiratory probs - see ur doc. that how it all started of me. be well. nice chatting,
1	
1	think i'm addicted to ventolin inhalers
1	hours sleep and still i feel tired and dizzy
1	bedtime. hopefully the headache and nausea from the levaquin will be gone leaving me with only the more common side effects of antibiotics.
1	thanks for sharing, dude! have you had issues w/nausea from strattera? i’m in a debate b/w that and vyvanse re: side effects
1	out of pills, feeling like a train wreck
1	this new baccy is just making my cough so much worse but ahhh well need my nicotine
1	8 day rivaroxaban diary. pracetamol has taken away most of the aches, but still have lower back ache and weak knees.
1	i've taken everything but my trazodone that's tonight, but the nasal spray is giving me a drip :|
1	i think baclofen might make me a bigger asshole than usual. :/
1	ugh the olanzapine makes me so tired
1	tamiflu killed my best friend i wouldnt want anyone to use that shit
1	i was on venlafaxine after the citalopram but it messed up my sleep
1	za doze ama? rt : ventolin has crazy effects walai /o\
1	my tremors are horrible. fuck seroquel.
1	fuck molly . vyvanse is what gets ya sweatin
1	i lost weight in the past but it was much easier. like steps forward, one step back on the quetiapine.
1	about to take mg of temazepam aka bezos and see how long i can stay awake should be fun
1	i think i finally feel the last of the toxins slithering loudly out of my body. dr's shouldn't prescribe medicine that does this.
1	- whilst i was maxed on tegretol, neurontin &amp; lyrica for pain management, my memory and decision-making ability were all shot
1	"""vyvanse was like aderall and crack i got ten minutes of sleep pearl"""
1	seroquel will make you sleep for hours.
1	no one ever tells you that lunesta gives you late night cravings until you can't fit into your dress pants for your presentation tonight.
1	take paxil then. no anxiety just happiness. but you et withdraws if you forget to take it.
1	i had to taper myself down. i think the seroquel gave me lasting sleep paralysis. i've had it ever since.
1	is my memory really bad due to mg seroquel and mg cymbalta or the bipolar itself? i'm not remembering conversations
1	oh i hate that! i used to be on citalopram, it stopped working eventually. sometimes i have to up my effer dose temporarily.
1	i try to be sexy, sad or quiet. so i'm ranting about how the antibiotic levaquin has caused me permanent nerve damage over
1	"this cipro is totally ""killing"" my tummy .. hiks.."
1	trying not to worry, but this tysabri is a scary drug. hope it's just a bug
1	takin anbien &amperoquel for bad insomnia gives u messed up dreams doc saids its normal
1	i have very severe hip pain. dihydrocodeine and diclofenac aren't helping. suggestions?
1	doctor warned me a side effect of advair was headache and to drink (about) a liter of water if i ended up with one.
1	i think i might be allergic to effer. i just woke up feeling sick, meh.
1	i'm on enbrel right now... not starting mtx til november. i know that 'hungover' feeling though hope it gets better for u!
1	nicotine withdrawal is hitting me so fuckin hard right now
1	yeah i hear epilim is pretty tough, sorry to hear re bad times with it oddly, dear sweet lamotrigine tipped me to a dark place
1	well, i'm now convinced humira &amp; enbrel were the culprits of my weight gain! other tnf will likely result in same. now what?
1	what to do? not looking forward to cold turkey withdrawals from pristiq... sense of impending doom. anxiety only makes the situation worse.
1	anxiety has been so high. but yeah, if your dosage is high its hard to come off. i had to detox from pristiq (its cousin drug)
1	the is kicking in. bizarre thoughts tonight. tempted to take the whole lot. i won't - don't worry people. just odd thoughts.
1	my medication is making me stupid, brain meds are not ok , fuck u paxil
1	yeah, remicade and humira both caused me extra trouble. methotrexate didn't work and it also made me feel a lot worse.
1	fuck here comes the nicotine cravings damn you hookah
1	its your third visit in weeks for priapism and you're still taking trazodone
1	“: my vyvanse makes me nocturnal ”
1	you don't know insomnia until you take seroquel and work out at am.
1	i would like to know what everyone else's eerience are of baclofen and clonazepam. do they get dry nose / throat?
1	oh hello seroquel old friend i mi*passes out on bed*
1	saphris makes my mouth numb i can't deal with this shit.
1	you can see why i need a break! it's the pregabalin or as i prefer to call it, pre-babbling.
1	i wish i hadn't taken levaquin and prednisone right before bed.
1	olanzapine is another anti-psychotic medication. it works on my bipolar but makes me binge eat
1	's vioxx was rushed through by the fda, too - and killed my husband. testing results were distorted, hidden. fda was complicit.
1	i was just diagnosed months ago and im on birthcontrol and was on metformin but it made me too sick so i quit cold turkey
1	i'm sorry to hear that. i had a side effect from humira that negated all tnf blockers so no enbrel for me either.
1	i had a very bad reaction to victoza and the fever it caused sent my glucose up to &amp; i had to go back to insulin to sort.
1	snort seroquel, black out.. woo!!
1	although my bitching about being fat did look a but comical next to my brother, with his olanzapine induced weight gain.
1	metformin only has gi upset issues mostly, other than that its quite safe, but i take it because i need it
1	i spent a week in the hospital for sepsis, heroic doses of levaquin that made things taste funny for a month.
1	why can't i sleep like a normal person. oh yeah because i suffer from insomnia and trazodone gives me headaches
1	advair literally made me shrink an inch how is that possible
1	what is this weird feeling i've been having all day? i've felt depressed yet oddly happy. this is the second day of bid
1	yea the humira should definitely help, that or remicade! just let her know the shot itself doesn't hurt but the fluid burns
1	ok. it's the chill that worrys me, i take pregabalin morphine paracetamol. ...&amp; ipubrofane if u don't take never get chill&gt;
1	i'm fine w/ advair &amp; flonase. prednisone = rage monster.
1	taking synthroid for my thyroid disease has weight like falling off..... besides my tummy &amp; their being a baby there i feel like a skelton.
1	anyone on pristiq withdrawals?
1	eurgh! last time i was this tired, i was on a four day antidepressant cocktail binge.
1	you can say that again! i trusted my doc and ended up crippled thanks to just cipro pills. going on years now.
1	slept. ate. did yoga. lamictal + latuda = pain? any comments/opinions?
1	was on keppra came off them as they stopped me feeling hungry and i lost to much weight i'm now on vimpat
1	//pardon the upcoming loopy tweets. taking some oxycodone soon for the pain.
1	currently :14 am.... still can't sleep. adderall still not fading. still have my am final........
1	i'm becoming too tolerant to vyvanse
1	latuda made me lose function in my neck. it was just sagging there at linden lmfao
1	for all you my meds are completely legal and i'm stoked to be on vyvanse cause strattera was worsening my depression. so
1	just had my enbrel injection for this week.. can just tell straightaway when it's hit a bad area in the stomach ouch
1	at the end of most working days! i still have to nap loads just to get through a week. some days better than others
1	/77 pre aubagio /93 post aubagio they tell me im the lucky % who gets high bp? wheres my tiny violin im gonna bash my doc with it
1	q makes me hungry. olanzapine made me want to eat my own arm!
1	to take my seroquel and have weird dreams or to not... real life lyndsey world questions
1	oh that was only last night when i was delirious on quetiapine - you took advantage of the situation.
1	he mentioned effer but cant take it cuz i was on it &amp; geodon the same &amp; ended up in the hospital,dont know which caused it
1	it was th period when i was still fucked up off them vicodins &amp; seroquel. i remember it was lunch &amp; i left because something pissed me off.
1	started taking metformin and been throwing up constantly
1	food doesn't help for energy, not sure how to get some get up and go!
1	rt : i miss the days when i take mg seroquel with a bottle of wine and wake up standing in the kitchen naked, i literally mi…
1	i was on both, effer st, it stopped working me &amp; changed to pristiq that worked better. finding the right dosage is key
1	venlafaxine definitely does mine. also makes me need hours sleep a day. hence now unmediated &amp; rollercoastery.
1	at this point i have so much adderall in my system i probably won't sleep for the next days
1	oh, and i forgot that with lamotrigine come awful night terrors. i woke up no fewer than five times screaming and sweaty.
1	btw, i use vyvanse to prevent sudden drowsiness from either viibryd or abilify. just saying, for those who never heard of the pill before.
1	trying to keep up with a football game is very difficult under the influence of oxycodone
1	9 day rivaroxaban diary. aches are related to pressure on my body, e.g. if sitting then in back, buttoocks and legs /2
1	whoah so dizzing. damn tamazapam - shld probably wap back to quetiapine if this keeps up! but it makes me feel so ick!
1	i understand bystolic does mess with losing weight, but i've still slowly pulled it off. the ptu is a new challenge now.
1	rivaroxaban /2 if i could float weightless in space i suspect i would not ache. but i can't so need rid of rivaroxaban.
1	my vision is blurred rn from tbis oxycodone
1	i only had very mild side effects from viibryd (a strange floaty feeling) for a couple of days, then nothing.
1	just popped nonstimulant adderall pills (not the good stuff) and now my mind is like soaring and i think im going crazy
1	/25/09 cdc response i contracted h1n1 days prior ,prescribed tamiflu wife i grieving her death on this day.u lie di-fi

1	whoa quetiapine stop making me feel drowsy yo
1	just got prescribed to oxycodone and i can't feel a damn thing
1	things which are the spawn of satin: mosquitoes, bananas, facebook, paxil withdrawal symptoms.
1	coming off cymbalta sucks, i've been slowly cutting back for the past months. have finally made it over a weeks since i have taken it.
1	i confused my metformin with my antibiotics and overdosed. bad stomach cramps. i'm a moron.
1	vyvanse at pm probably wasn't a great idea.. i can't sleeeep -__-
1	(cont'd) my pdoc altered the dosage of to mg. that's the only alteration. because i complained about the extreme fatigue.
1	tendons still achillin me, some levaquin humor..
1	i do injections monthly. it's a very thick gel. remicade was like water and slow. humira burned but not like this.
1	girl my doc raised my dosage for metformin and i have been so sick all damn day! i feel your pain
1	i'd rather be on the effer that made me happy though i had severe back pain from it.. than sad and crying for no reason on lexapro....
1	im diabetic - i was on metformin since and had this yr b taken off it harmed my kidneys. i am on meds for diabetes now only diet.
1	ewww took a saphris to fall asleep and now i just feel like i'm gonna throw up.
1	i'm with you. even though the pristiq works, i still don't feel fully human.
1	i'm sorry you have ostrich halitosis but that is a side effect of once monthly boniva.
1	rivaroxaban diary day . last tablet taken tuesday th, days ago. woken up in pain. bad fluid retention (uneven) on both legs.
1	nexium may increase your risk of getting severe diarrhea.
1	my dr. will be starting me on humira cuz i had no luck w/remicade. hope u're better soon -positive
1	fuck you trazodone. i didn't want or need to sleep for hours.
1	i've had no appetite since i started on prozac, i guess that's a good thing
1	coz olanzapine increases hunger strains u all day dosile unless u get up when ur accilies still wud n coffee am fog frost
1	totally down with possible decreased appetite/decreased weight side effect of this pristiq tbh
1	just had a marathon sleep past hrs on new dose of -hope my liver will be ok on it.woke with stressy tummy pains.
1	my choice was more on -ft small bowel or like . now is my only hope treat side effect.
1	seroquel left me with sleep paralysis. abilify left me with occasional muscle spasms. i've been off of both for nearly a decade.

1	well hello am. thanks lunesta for not doing your one job
1	i've been on humira going on years now; was on enbrel previously - worked for a few yrs then lost some effectiveness
1	oh! i am on enbrel but i was on methotrexate prior to that, it didn't agree with me and wasn't effective for me so
1	really bad idea to eat chili for dinner when your sick to you stomach. and never taking metformin in the morning again.
1	i'm on gabapentin now, it's not really working for me..but everyone is different. gabapentin makes me feel drunk
1	don't take lunesta tho it made my friend see double
1	seroquel?? hell i take half of the lowest dosage and i am knocked on my ass!!
1	since quetiapine's messed with my prolactin levels, making my boobs humungous &amp; my bras so eensive, i want a lingerie component to dla.
1	levofloxacin seems to be our worst offender for inr elevation
1	it wasn't an easy victory though. felt like chemo with the cipro. as for the heart, i meant for study purposes.
