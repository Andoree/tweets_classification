i tried giving ventolin to my patients before, pero they never had that jittery feeling... hmmmm~~?
Затем, чтобы никогда, ни у кого (кроме Бабиковых) никаких вопросов не возникало. И в основном, ТИ касаются не сальбутамола

latuda is really taking a toll on me, i've never been this tense. maybe it has to do with the healing meditation last night.

deb needs a throat lozenge
take your damn advair everyday and that won't happen. how many years i been yelling at you about this? jeez!!
patients can't talk with him without fainting. for this reason, dr.mario has to throw tamiflu capsules to everyone.
theraflu or tamiflu always helps me at least be functional. also dayquil.
for me, apixaban is the clear winner in terms of the noacs for af. our cardiologists have starting doling out it like smarties.

блять, @медуза, хуле вы тупите, ксанаксом не депрессию лечат, а тревожность, неврозы, панику/фобию и т.п. точнее даже, годится он лишь для разового снятия этого или коротких курсов, ибо быстро идёт привыкание за несколько недель, как и у многих из бензодиазепиновой группы

i'm convinced that the crestor commercial is the absolute stupidest commercial ever made on the face of the earth.
ahhhh, yeah i had that too. had some light sleeping pills for a while (trazodone) but your brain works it out eventually.
don't recall any adverse side effects. seemed to do its job until i hit a major depressive phase. then moved onto duloxetine.
where the sildenafil
main pharmacovigilance updates in : dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade comprising aliskiren is harmful.
amitriptylline no longer used routinely due to cardiac effects. pregabalin is the new drug of choice.
trazodone was originally used for depression then they started using it as a sleeping pill because that's all it's good for.
but the biggie to prevent cogn. decline is namenda - fdaapproved only early onset alz; she sez should be off-market rx'd to everyone at
i'm nonchalantly suggesting restoril to all of my patients tonight

Лучшее лекарство из всех. Теперь не надо меня в случае приступа кидать в ледяную ванну. Увы, люди не понимают что тестом на реакцию на вентолин определяют есть ли у человека астма, он не действует на тех, у кого ее нет. Как будто он каким-то волшебным образом легкие увеличивает.
велаксин офигенный. пожалуй единственный из антидепрессантов, который реально помогает и лечит. улучшения на лицо.

@Lieslia_Sau Кровь, скорее, из-за того, что препарат оказался еще и сосудосуживающим - этого лучше не надо, там привыкание слизистой, если &gt;7 дн. Азеластин норм. Будесонид и Беклометазон еще хорошо - это глюкокортикоиды, но из-за местного применения на надпочечники не действуют.
it's all well &amp; good to say you're going to give this pt a geodon shot if he becomes violent, but it'd be nice if you gave him the shot.
sos i havent slept for hours im on adderall i cant scream
after vegas bombs, mg trazodone, &amp; week old chinese food i dreamt i was animated with francine. thanx mate.
a shug ? is that a self hug? wish i could do that - damm thalidomide
i live at around a pain level -7 on oxycontin mg/day, topamax mg, cymbalta mg. i get down to pain free when i take
why the fuck am i awake? this is why my doctor prescribed me to seroquel... cause i can't sleep at all.
subone methadone this class outta control
it's called levofloxacin or levaquin. is that the one?
i have been on enbrel for a year..now on mtx and remicade next month. i have as and psa
don't worry about it. that's why hope (however pointless) is critical to our survival. rt : i'm gonna need some cymbalta lol
amitiza (lubiprostone) - is about $ per day on average
mdd or bipolar for me too. had serious episode of mania. depressed all the other time. effer is really working for me now.

girl my doc raised my dosage for metformin and i have been so sick all damn day! i feel your pain
no because she told mr she's on cymbalta.
Так паксил тоже должен был, вроде как. А где? А что? Я что-то в шоке и наставила себе уже диагнозов.

yeah i'm allergic to plaquenil and ibuprofen won't help. ask for robaxin, lyrica and hydrocodone /325.
i really hope someone puts scoops of miralax in 's coffee tomorrow morning. what an unbelievable shithead.
i like how adderall makes me feel
forbes article regarding gsk stock plummeting gives cause for concern. advair being off largest pbm,eress scripts formulary hurt.
i need a lozenge for my throat.
Огосподи, ну если «не есть», то результат будет без метформина. А вообще погуглите «инсулинорезистентность» и как с ней бороться. Это будет получше, чем жрать невыписанные врачом таблетки. Метформин кстати снижает витамины В в организме, о чем мало кто знает.
Кто-нибудь пил препарат Номидес? И не заработал офигительный список побочек, указанный в инструкции?? Вопрос непраздный в разгар вирусных заболеваний
ah spoke too soon lol lozenge only helped numb the pain. now that it's melted, i'm back to feeling the burn -,-

Купи Вентолин, он стоит 100-200 руб, продаётся без рецепта, мне его врач в своё время и назначил, как и многим моим знакомым-астматикам. Он и без астмы рекомендован, если именно задыхаешься от кашля.
لكن... both brilinta and plavix should be stopped days before surgery...and effient at least days beforehand.
together tamiflu and i are feeling as though we could conquer the world in the possibly the next week or so.

are you on paxil .. i need help
Держал только Паксил. От Велафакса и Тералиджена вообще мало толку. Одна сонливость и ещё более депрессивная апатия. Атаракс быстро тоже не помогает. Возвращаться к Паксилу уже поздно.  Чёртова суицидальная хандра. Помогает алкоголь, но днём его нельзя. Мир умирает- это прекрасно
i don't know how name brand medications get their outrageous names.. like prestiq and xarelto. like what the fuck does that mean.
i'll just slip it in..."and by the way, januvia isn't first line."
i need a prescription for oxybutynin so i can drink coffee on longer car rides
adderall makes me the happiest person alive...and then it wares off and turns me into a horrible person. lol night and day.
no. plus you must eat with them. i took diclofenac on empty stomach once. never again.
сульпирид и кветиапин часто делают. А вот в башкирии, почему то амитриптилин делают вместо анафранила обычно.

Сколько я по максимуму ел? Пачку? 40мг. На форумах же было 150-300. Все затрудняет то, что сама таблетка с содержанием лоперамида 2мг весит около 50-100, точно не скажу. Может, есть вариант выпарить, перегнать, перекристаллизовать?.. Правда меня на кухне за это убьют :^)
Дайте же ей уже Имодиуму, да побольше. Ведь вся сейчас изойдет на

Принимайте антидепрессант из группы СИОЗКР (ингибиторы серотонина), рексетин, пароксетин, они убирают эти симптомы и делают курение бессмысленным. Лучший это бупропион, но его нет в аптеках КР.

Ну на самом деле гомеопатия при ОРЗ лучше противовирусных препаратов. У действенных противовирусных препаратов (типа тамифлю) вероятны сильные побочки, так что лечить ими что-то кроме серьезного гриппа - это как тараканов напалмом морить.

hi michael, we had to buy mom's meds through canadian pharmacy. seventy dollars ea. for namenda and exelon.
they have steroids and like some other shit in them. can't remember now but alvesco is like basically inhaled prednisone w/i
$isis agree, results not consistent if % rate in p1. however, stated they compared directly kynamro &amp; other gen2 in healthies
even better than that: aciphex
really though, when used properly (and with the new fda lower-acetaminophen rules) hydro and oxycodone products are pretty safe
where can i go to get an adderall / vyvanse / focalin / cocaine prescription?
latuda is a drug for bipolar depression. and the side effect is death. so that's great.
sounds like fun! hope antib's work this time. are you on humira?

что вам могут выписать: алпразолам, лоразепам, феназепам, тетраметилтетраазабициклооктандион (адаптол), фабомотизол, гидроксизин (атаракс), клоназепам (хотя он относится к группе противоэпилектиков), нитразепам, флунитразепам (снотворные но все равно их выписывают для кукухи).
Оксикодон это плохо, но оксимирон ещё хуже.

Потому что эти методы будут использоваться лет через 5-20,когда пройдут все возможные проверки и будут одобрены всеми возможными организациями,иначе никак. Однажды был случай с талидомидом,так после этого проверки ужесточились колоссально,и это правильно.
Что делать, если фенозепам и алпразолам перестали работать. Как справляться с этим всем теперь.

Выпила венлафаксин и буря в голове, которая мучила меня со вчерашнего дня, успокоилась. Обычно меня сильно тошнит через 2-3 часа после приёма, когда препарат достигает максимальной концентрации в крови, но в этот раз обошлось. Как же спокойно, хорошо.

рубрика «сомнительные эксперименты на ночь глядя»: смещается ли выпитый на ночь кветиапин с алкоголем, который я выпила до этого (всего два бокала ликера и тоника)
Недели три как, но недавно повысил кветиапин. Насчет пик в данном случае полностью согласен.
когда в апреле мне сменили ад и добавили нормотимик, то дышать стало легче, и голова как-то посветлела, ночные истерики сократились. в июне добавили габапентин и наконец прекратились невропатические боли. я могу ходить, сидеть, спать, лежать и не ощущать адские боли по всему телу

а чем пахнут твои волосы флуоксетином и концентрированным фенобарбиталом. привет. мне так тебя не хватало.
Майкл Фелпс,.13 апреля в ходе соревнований в принял  габапентина. Это  средство,  входит в список запрещённых веществ для лошадей
такой вопрос  почему мне назначают флувоксамин а не флуоксетин, который работает аналогично, но стоит ДЕШЕВЛЕ в пятьсот раз
Забыл кулстори рассказать. В одно время я пил по 4 таблетки флуоксетина в день, по назначению врача (итого 80мг флу), в то время постоянно одной из бывших кончал в рот и.. она подсела на флуоксетин. Лол. У нее даже побочки от "него" начались
жрут флуоксетин, шоб не кончать через пару минут, потом на отмене начинают хуйню чудить. хотя, пожирание антидеприков для торможения эякуляции - уже хуйня, само по себе.
я слезал (с венлафаксина, но все же) так: в какой-то момент решительно берешь таблетку и раз в день откусываешь половину остатка, пока не останется совсем маленький неоткусываемый кусочек, это и будет последний прием. Слез легко, до этого пытался два раза резко бросить безуспешно
Идёт третья неделя с адепресс, жизнь спокойна и безмятежна.  Осталось на 10 дней, думаю ещё продлить, или чего нового попробовать
@Feldsher669 @VikChek А метоморфин вместо метформина??  Часто так говорят
съев пачку прегабалина  меня осенило, как она красива
Ребенок с приступом астмы попал 4 ноября в стационар в Вичуге.Нет лекарства-ФЛИКСОТИД.До 8 отдам из дома.А дальше что?
Меня флуоксетин спасал, чтоб кукухой не поехать)
рекомендую лоперамид - останавливает кишечные неожиданности

Ах блять так это прозак ну на хуй тогда его ну на хуй
Я бы на твоем месте барыжила прозаком и купалась в бабках
- Айфоны такая вещь, что живут до первого ксанакса. Поэтому у меня "четвёрка".
Грустно, что из-за таблетонек не могу толком побыть русским поэтом: как начал пить флуоксетин, нихуя не пишется совершенно. Для текста нужен некий эмоциональный заряд и какой-то образный толчок, а с эмоциональностью все стало, мягко говоря, НИКАК.
Mood: плакать в ванной потому что заебало быть тупым никчемным кожаным мешком.  Как можно догадаться, флуоксетин мою эндогенную депрессию не очень вывозит.
мне нравится под ксанаксом заниматься сексом
пусть ВОЗ для начала считать научиться,а не усредняет циферки, всем известно как они продлевают сроки годности тамифлю и подобным препаратам,а также занижают или завышают цифры пострадавших при эпидемиях,и пусть приведут цифры обследовных в странах европы на 1000 населения,
Так же наблюдение о ламотриджине: Снятся ГОРЬКИЕ кошмары. В них нет ужаса, только отвратительная горечь, после которой хочется рыдать
Сам левофлоксацин в/в стоит 110р за бутыль, а вот он же под другими торговыми названиями-"Элефлокс" стоит  420р, "Таваник" 1600 руб !!!😱
@adagamov Хотел бы я посмотреть на умника, надышавшегося аэрозолей от астмы ради прилива сил😂  Бронхоспазм и в морг)) Цена эксперимента 150 рублей, ругающие норвежцев, в аптеке покупаете Вентолин, делаете допинговые 10 ингаляций и пешком на 5 этаж, скорую вызовите заранее😂
Норвежские спортсмены привезли на Олимпийские игры в Пхенчхан более 6000 доз лекарств от астмы: "1800 доз симбикорта, по 1200 доз атровента, альвеско и айромира, 360 доз вентолина (действующее вещество - сальбутамол), а также 43 ингалятора и 10 небулайзеров".
Лоперамид? Да, вижу, ты опытен в поносах
Почему у меня в контактах есть Велаксин?
Можно ли приобрести флуоксетин без рецепта?
снилось, что простыла оч сильно, пришла к врачу, а он мне выписал ламотриджин сны аффективницы - они такие
Сегодня в аптеке спросили, зачем мне столько Ламиктала. О_о
@irenemakarova а я его стала редко пить, поэтому у меня его ещё с остатком  с ламикталом проблемы в основном(
@SGaG1979 Похоже на вирус или грипп. Начинается тихо. Потом, может , кашель. Пневмония. Это очень опасно! Скорую вызывать надо. Если есть импортный Paracetamol , то очень хорошо. И Тамифлю. Тоже бы из-за границы.  Без антибиотиков не обойтись
Мой лечащий врач не знает, что я пью в три раза больше флуоксетина, чем мне прописано.  Но сейчас он закончился ВЕСЬ🙀
Чё там еще кроме прозака убивает нахрен аппетит?
пойду закинусь ксанаксом и порежу вены чтоль

Москва! Аттракцион небывалой щедрости: покажете мне рецепт - я отдам вам за три пачки Мальборо с кнопками 12 таблеток Золофта 50 мг, за четыре - 20 таблеток Флуоксетина 20 мг. Рассматриваю другие варианты обмена. Рт плз, вдруг кому надо.
У антибиотика Таваник в побочных эффектах значится бессоница. Так вот.  Это именно то, что я вспоминаю пытаясь заснуть с 22 часов.
Лучше ездить на маршрутке и слушать в дороге «розовое вино», чем ебашить на машине в жару, по супер дорогам Брянска и тупить как Паша техник под ксанаксом.
@Zanuda40 @dibart1 крестор считается самым безопасным статином. от  аналогов печень болела.  можно попробовать трайкор, кстати.

да у меня и при занятости постоянный нарушения сна. видимо нужен ящик ксанакса)))
Мне надо метформин. Вы щас по названию подумали что я нарик на игле? Неееет,просто у бабули,которой 67, и у меня(20,если шо) одинаковые диагнозы. Несмешно,но я ржу
Нитроглицерин, Оланзапин в большой дозе помогут облегчить мне жизнь
Паксил даст мне второго меня на 4мес
так все, я дремать, ксанакс уже больше суток держит, отходос ваще мда
Лучше брать Ламолеп, качество чуть выше.
поняла секрет похудения на велаксине
@derloos Точно) Но это не отменяет того, что они обе мерзкие какие-то. Не хватает сеалекса для полного набора.
А у меня по сути ну это вообще самые стандартные таблетки без оболочки как анальгин какой-нибудь (то ли дело допустим (ЧОНГУК) кветиапин глотать любо-дорого)
интернет трындит что лил пип съел пять ксанаксов, передознулся и умер  вспомнила как летом съела 25(!) марок с ксанаксом, запила вином и из всех негативных(?) проявлений было только то, что я моргнула в такси на секунду и оказалась дома, предварительно наблевав рядом с машиной
@bfrdfwhtm вообще прямо херово это стало в 2к15, когда мне выписали (ненужный) прозак (и даже не дали рецепта кст!! вот вам и психиатры за 4к 🤦🏼‍♀️), и в целом это осталась последняя тайна моего естества™️ в плане диагностики, типа спасусь ли я физ-рой или это эээ глубинные артро(?)штуки
Кароче на этой неделе в свободное время и на следующей попробую купить в местной аптеке велаксин с русским рецептом))) удачи мне Надеюсь продадут

Велаксин с кофе, чаем или алкоголем не мешай
Фен это транквилизатор. Вот с этим точно лучше не шутить. Хотя.. алпразолам (он же ксанакс) — транк, и утренняя таблетка могла вечером закончиться случайной вечеринкой. Правда я тогда пил совсем чуть-чуть, но похмелье становилось в 2-3 раза тяжелее.
Засиделся и забыл выпить кветиапин, подумал, что не стоит его так поздно пить, я же не смогу встать. Угадайте что. 4 ЧАСА УТРА Я НЕ МОГУ УСНУТЬ ПИЗДЕЦ
слезно прошу сейчас всех девочек и мальчиков не худеть на голодовках или с помощью таблеток . если вы действительно считаете, что вам нужно сбросить немного, то лучше перестаньте есть сладкое, мучное и жареное. это намного лучше, чем закидываться прозаком или слабительным

Для справки: Прием флуоксетина может вызывать сильные побочные эффекты, такие как неконтролируемые движения, нарушение половой функции, заикание, тик, потеря слуха, маниакальные приступы, паранойя и интенсивная тяга к самоубийству.

Поняла что отныне с родственниками могу общаться только под ксанаксом. Ну хотя я пожалуй это ещё полтора года назад поняла

пила (сероквель), дикая сонливость, скачет давление, чуть в обморок не упала от него :(
Флуоксетин дает мне серотонина исключительно на карманные расходы. Типа на, купи себе мороженку и посмейся с друзьями, только не трать все сразу.
200 доз сальбутамола от астмы. сначала (ещё вентолин) - на год. потом (ещё саламол) - на полгода. сейчас - на три недели.  rip. 🚮
нет, рецепта на прегабалин у меня нет
Баклофен - здравствуй ,рад принять вас снова ^^
тем временем от ламиктала заболела спина. нет добра без худа - теперь так
@upgrade16121 Сероквель, сам знаешь зачем столько съела
у меня есть товарищ, стоматолог. недавно уснул в лифте под баклофеном

они обычно фликсоназе прописывают (уменьшает отёк, но только пока капаешь) и настоятельно рекомендуют подправить перегородку.

Пока молодые рэперы читают о марихуане и ксанаксе, Гречка занимает позицию своей лирической героини — разбитной старшеклассницы, которая возвращается домой к матери поздно и пьяная.
Со следующего месяца снова посижу на флуоксетине Или сдохну или убью кого нибудь
День прошёл удачно, если ты не съел смертельную дозу флуоксетина
@AlexandrZaedaet хотя, начинала  я с него,потом перешла на велафакс.
Четыре врача поставили диагноз, где-то валяются рецепты на паксил и золофт, но мне похер.
У него операция по ушиванию желудка была. А метформин не стероид совсем, от слова нифига. И это не побочка скорее всего, а энцефалопатия на фоне плохо леченого диабета.
@RT_russian Не могли ему имодиум что ли предложить?
У Майкла Мура был как-то фильм про это.Здравозахоронение,что ли. там детей с детсада признают гиперактивными и сажают на прозак.В школе отказ от седативных якобы влечет наказание.Самые бошковитые свои продают тем,кто уже подсел.Не знаю, правда или нет,но в фильме это есть
Короче, полторы бутылки вина на пустой желудок и флуоксетин - это не то, что вы хотите пережить. Такого страшного похмелья у меня давно не было.

@gloomy_buffoon Ну, вот и задыхаешься. Не астма у тебя а бронхит курильщика.Ингалятор купи в аптеке Вентолин или по сильнее Беродуал
Карбамазепин вкупе с флуоксетином таки помогают. Уже не хочу всех бить. Агрессия максимум десять минут
Тааак. Два дня с температурой на работе провела. Еще три дня до этого была дома. Сегодня кашель с ночи. Фак. И нос закладывает. И еще аллергия села сверху. Вентолин форева
Было установлено что даже одна таблетка талидомида в период 20-30 дней после зачатия уже гарантировала пороки. Как вы сами понимаете, даже сейчас есть девушки которые на таком сроке не осознают что они беременны, а что говорить о тех временах.
флуоксетин в печень никто не вечен
У меня короче пошли все побочки. От сульпирида сонливость и сверхутомляемость, а от флуоксетина гипервозбудимость и бессонница. Класс.
Опиаты — это прекрасно, друзья! Оксикодон даже лучше викодина, но самый шик — это морфий внутривенно.

Но тип нах тебе метформин?
все успокоились, покурили, легли спать, я накормила ее ксанаксом и заснула в пять утра под ее всхлипывания и завывания. в семь разбудил звонок матери о том, что она сейчас у своей матери разносит дом и они хотят вызывать ментов, я сказала, что это бред и она спит тут с нами.

Новая бывшая телка гуфа говорит, что травка подавит и затмит все твои желания. И тебе и ксанакса захочется, и кокса, и чего угодно.
Если это не поможет, тамифлю диэн мощнай эмп баар, но он больше 1 к стоит, но эффект того стоит
купи ингалятор и делай ингаляции лазолваном и беродуалом. Но лучше пусть врач назначит лекарства. В крайнем случае пульмикорт
Кодеин, трамадол, прегабалин Детка, я в говно
"Когда ты известен, ты рискуешь, принимая левотироксин натрия, чтобы оставаться худым.Да, ты должен беспокоиться о своей ЦНС.У тебя бессонница.Твой метаболизм резко возрастает.Твое сердце стучит.Ты потеешь.Ты нервничаешь всё время, но ты выглядишь потрясающе." Паланик "Уцелевший"
Алпразолам, Он же ксанакс. Чудеснейшее лекарство. Мне, как биполярнику, очень помогает. Если начинается стадия мании- закинул таблетки 4 и все. Снимает тревогу, дает эйфорию, на все становится похуй.
Вей на ксанаксе оказался милостивым крутым парнем

Постоянно хочется фурацилин назвать флуоксетином Привычка
Он как бы флуоксетин, и даже замена слов это знает, но я все равно говорю флукоцестин, что за параша. Но мне в принципе пофиг
За эти пару лет могу похвастаться приобретённой необходимостью в таких лекарствах как: феварин, респиредон торендо, фликсотид, винтолин, преднизолон для срочной помощи, тавегил для срочной помощи, ну и по мелочи. А меня ждёт ещё много дел. Но иногда не хочется.
Я же говорю очень интересное поражение! Третий и четвертый желудочки мозга! Сонапакс - даже не понял, что это было, триттико - деньги зря потратил. Дело не в гормоне сна, а в спиномозговой жидкости. Как мне сказали - не операбелно, не мешай врачам работать)

В комментах писали: вентолин и все другие. ингаляции. Желательно в условиях стационара. Это было бы правильно
Ну по-моему прозак/флуоксетин можно без рецепта) паксил тоже в свое время был

конечно ксанакса въебал вот и спокоен
а мы это кто? кто там против ксанакса??
Не пополняют лекарства в аптеке, пока не схожу к доку, а он только через 3 недели лол. Но надеюсь, что моя наглость таки победит его расписание и мы увидимся раньше. Поэтому начался резкий отходняк от венлафаксина, да такой, что я за пределы вселенной каждые 10 минут вылетаю
для поднятия потенции селекционного отдела явно нужен Сеалекс
велаксин. действует как мет, но в составе другие вещества
У меня после флуоксетина так было)
просто Джерард говорил про ксанакс и я сразу же ТАК ТАК ТАК
Стоило только вчера убеждённо сказать, что дозировку прегабалина мы 100% будем снижать. Стоило. Как выразительно заболела правая ручечка! Ух
Совершенно непонятно почему люди так брезгливо относятся к бутирату и прегабалину, отличные же вещи.  Бутират вообще достаточно полезен, защищает нервные клетки во время гипоксии, а в сочетании с кокаином (или любым другим ингибитором обратного захвата дофамина) очень приятный
Приснилось, что у меня была куча маленьких крысят, и я их накормила баклофеном. Что блять.
аня говорит, что я злой такой сегодня, потому что у нас паксил закончился, так что может быть я большую часть времени и не злой вообще. но если что, отписывайтесь от меня
Мне нужна таблетка, хотя бы половинка. Да, хотя бы половинка ксанакса, а то пиздец так жить.
@Donna_132 @amammamia Материальный голос разума концентрацией воли и прозака мобилизуется

Я пил флуоксетин (Прозак - это торговая марка), пил его около года, вроде бы было все в порядке. Это вопрос не ко мне, нужно обращаться к специалисту.
А как же "Молодой человек у вас не всё в порядке с головой. Вот вам рецепт к на прозак. Только постарайтесь не суициднутся".
У меня рпп - побочка-симптом. Но когда начала лечение, похудела даже на сероквеле. Каким раком - хз. Сероквель не пью, снова толстею :):):)

@DmtPublic Некоторый высвобождают адреналин из "запаса", некоторые напрямую содержат адреналин. Все препараты(Фликсотид, Симбикорт;Флунисолид, Сальбутамол;Бекотид, Будесонид;Бекломет, Беклометазон;Ингакорт, Бенакорт, Флутиказон) являются сильнейшими стимуляторами дыхания.
блин гаряв я с июня живу без сахара и сладостей вообще зато с метформином и вот тебе парочка советов как не умереть
Паксил помогал, но с него надо уметь слезать, синдром отмены очень выраженный. Самочувствие как при гриппе, и может долго держаться, неделю-две.
Потому что так сокращают названия препаратов из оксикодона)
мне его прописали! цифран и ксефокам. и кетаролом догналась. вроде полегче уже
А красненькое это оксикодон или гидроморфон?
паксил, а лепривон и феназепам я наверное пропущу потому что я от них засыпаю за полчаса
Ничего, если он к тебе попадёт на приём в следующий раз ты ему выпишешь вместо лоперамида фордрайв!
что же, Сероквель реально помогает спать. а про раздражительность пока говорить наверное рано
прочитала что в побочках у моего антидепрессанта депрессия,подумала что было б классно если бы все лекарства так работали, пошла чекнуть побочки имодиума и там реально есть увеличение силы паноса из жопы
А потом сразу уже прозак хуярить, чего уж там)
Каковы риски при том, что я пью препараты, содержащие ламотриджин, в дозировке 200мг./день минимум не с целью лечения эпилепсии?
сегодня я допила последнюю таблетку паксила
Загадить своё здоровье флуоксетином, лечиться и при этом снова захотеть его пить ? Как нех делать
Вина Ваших недоколлег тамошних (психиатров). Меньше бы прозак с диазепамом и подобными жрали, было бы все на порядок лучше
@ksushamosss задал обычный вопрос для мужика, а в итоге почувствовал себя дэбилом. ну женщины, умеете вы так! а новаринг - это контрацептивное вагинальное кольцо.
@LustHoly @C0FFIN4Y0U @Ally_Besoalone А я еще пароксетин пил, правда после него еще фенибут пришлось
коллеги сказали ей, что у меня может быть редкая реакция на ламотриджин и я хочу спать из-за него  судя по всему я хочу спать вообще от всего
У меня аллергия на собак и с детства с ними живу. Приучай себя и собаку к минимальному контакту. Они это со временем начинают понимать. Держи дом в КРИСТАЛЬНОЙ ЧИСТОТЕ. Антигистаминное хорошее на случай, если контакт случился - фликсоназе. Отпускает через 5 минут.
Сегодня вечером только я и пачка флуоксетина
@ura_ru когда-нть лютым неведомым контрабасом под видом пармезана или другого вкусного и полезного накормят редакцию ура.ру и лишат имодиума и выхода в клозет я б посмотрел
а я, наверно, могу и прозак достать но я же не настолько глупая, да? я же не такая идиотка?
Хочу быть втипажной для хумки Флуоксетина хддддд
Разродился для своих описанием опыта с флуоксетином. Резюме: консультируйтесь с врачом.
тамифлю только при гриппе, циклоферон - индуктор интеоферона, людям с проблемами с иммунитетом с осторожностью
Только что была свидетелем попытки молодого человека купить баклосан. Он хитро это назвал обезбаливающим, но сказали, что уже несколько лет его не завозят. По ходу больше никакой радости и расслабления в этой жизни
@generaIanna Это не вопрос количества приемов пищи, а в первую очередь их качества. Вы за уровнем Б12 следите? Метформин особенно при  таких дозировках блокирует его всасывание. Это очень серьезно сказывается на имуннитет и метаболизма. Инсулин у вас все равно высокий очень. надо не выше 5
В части ТВ и "вирусной природы рака"-возможно. Однако я не уверен, что в любой "иной" стране старички "такие все ох-ые". Так же, море народа "за 40" сидит на "Прозаке". Как минимум. Причем жестко назначают , "пока не перестанешь приходить и жаловаться".Видел "там" и знаком.
Как прокомментируешь смерть Лил Пипа от передоза ксанаксом?
@proza_c @xVenya Принцесса Прозак?  Это большое упущение с их стороны. Представьте себе хоть одну диснеевскую принцессу, которая вовремя принимает все препараты.
Если ты дно пробил, то помогает имодиум. Какие там противопоказания?
У меня от сероквеля сильно ноги крутило и адский жор. Такой аппетитище, что кажется сможешь сожрать 3 супермаркета и еще в кафе зайти.
И? У меня так же с ламотриджином было. С 25 мг штормило, от 50 до сих пор в восторге, жизнь наладилась.
А что же это Вас, сударь, что не скажи, сразу на ассоциации тянет? С этим к докторам, Или таблеточку, на самый худой конец. "Ксанакс" или "Прозак" весьма способствуют.
ксанакс это алпразолам, список 3
Сны под ксанаксом так удивительны
@lyrique221 Но блин, мне его на долго не выпишут. Сказали ещё месяц и все, надо искать альтернативу..  конвалис, аналог, не походит, у меня на него побочки мне бы амитриптилин. Он мне легче всего идёт. У меня почему то на современные препараты побочек много.
вот это поворот. может, флуоксетина?
В диалоге кинули вакансию потестить ЛС (иммунодепрессант) за 50к, а последствия там очень агрессивные. Вот сейчас спорят, если умереть в середине теста, то похороны будут оплачены или нет? Адалимумаб - название препарата
Примерный список фармы, которую я пробовала: Кветиапин, пароксетин, эсциталопрам, ламотриджин,, гидроксизин, тофизопам, феназепам. Больше не вспомню. Сейчас кушаю эсциталопрам (антидепрессант) и ламотриджин (нормотимик) каждый день и гидроксизин при тревоге.

паша техник обещал новый альбом в конце июля а теперь пишет что его забирают в наркологичку я конечно понимаю что фанатская любовь безгранична но на одном ксанаксе далеко не уедешь
формула счастья : паксил +паксил
флуоксетин часто меняет цвет волос и вообще все меняет, ламотриджин постоянно проверяет себя на наличие сыпи, а рисперидон любит собирать цветочки и залипать в стенку
нет, гейство - побочка от паксила
Тот некурящий на прозаке, Хоуп(((
@sam_banshee Только метформин Всё серьёзно, но ещё не диабет, этого можно избежать, чем я и пытаюсь заниматься. Ну и да, там ещё другие плюшки, не связанные с этой темой, но там тоже надо следить за тем шо идёт в рот
Однажды меня заебёт моя никчемная жизнь и я куплю много-много атаракса, смешаю его с кетаролом и присыплю паксилом. И запью это вискарем.
Пароксетин.  Наконец-то начала видеть сны. Но тяжело просыпаться и постоянно сплю вечером. Хотя режим держался довольно долго (пару недель), сейчас уехал в полные ебеня. Однозначно смешанка, которая помогла мне в тяжёлый момент, когда надо было ебошить
Метформин и гликизид сбивает частично. Но всё равно надо корректировать диетой. Или кушать всё,но каждые 3 часа по 200г.Стакан супика,например.
у паксила максимально непрактичная упаковка таблеток кто вообще придумал покрывать блистеры не фольгой а бумагой
3 таблетки Венлаксора утром (лучше поесть, на пустой желудок тянет блевать) Паксил при ухудшении состояния днём 1-2 таблетки Рисполепта тоже днём На ночь Гидазепам (лучше чередовать с Милоксэнлм, чтоб избежать синдрома отмены)  Продолжайте думать, что я нормальный
не жрать по 18 часов и полировать это прозаком би лайк
Подняла себе левотироксин натрия . Веселюсь от души.
лил пип умер от ксанакса, сука( а xxxtentation умер от пули,сука(((
Как снотворное сразу. Но лечебный эффект в виде восстановившегося суточного цикла позже, надо курс пропить. Но если сильная бессонница, может не помочь. Мне в свое время только квентиакс помогал, а потом я уже мелаксен начала пить, когда сон как явление вообще появился в жизни)
Сдохнуть хочется. От паксила у меня падает давление и болит сердце, а валерьянка не помогает и мне реально очень очень плохо
И начала не с 500гр, а с 1000гр. А у меня даже диабет не стоит как диагноз. А у метформина куча побочек и вообще стремно принимать.
на завтрак вентолин, на полдник вентолин, на обед вентолин, на ужин вентолин. вентолин как ответ на все вопросы

народ можете по Гуглить кто лично занимался Тамифлю..я вообще к Йуле не очень..скажена баба ..но истина дороже!
аааа, так там в цене дело,они хотят что бы его вернули в список бесплатных лекарств,но 100 таблеток за 1100 не так уж и дорого,я папе каждый месяц за 2800 покупаю Прадаксу,не считая других лекарств
"если надо объяснять - то не надо объяснять". В подобной ситуации, мне помог препарат "триттико" (Trazodone). Но диагноз по аватарке, дело неблагодарное, лучше обратиться к специалисту.
Хочу рецепт на флуоксетин, кстати. От него руки дрожат, но жизнь играет яркими красками, всё такое
В твитторе проскользнула инфа, что какие-то особи используют габапентин (одно из моих колес), как рекреационный наркотик, что несомненно является долбоебизмом на уровне гликодина или солей.
Того, кто принесёт мне алпразолам или феназепам, зацелую до смерти
Выписали Цифрон или Ципролет на 5 дней, при болях Найз или Пенталгин. Ссыкотно чёт антибиотики

Я поняла в чем прикол. В инструкции эутирокса (для щитовидки) написано, что применение антидепрессантов усиливает эффект, опять же таки, антидепрессантов при параллельном использовании эутирокса

В целом, было вкусненько, но я все равно на всякий случай принял имодиум. Вообще мой лучший друг.
Послесловие: фармкомпания работает до сих пор. Немного изменила название, теперь она называется просто  Grünenthal . Со слов Википедии ее оборот 1,3 млрд. USD.     И как ни странно, но и талидомид не исчез в небытие.
Попробуй -адепресс, хорошо успокаивает, можно мешать с алкоголем, в сон не тянет, но зеваеш много. В идеале мешать его с парой таблеток фенибута, 3-пиразидола, и 100гр виски., блеск
@wP9LlUePqmJOK6R это же ксанакс? от него вроде зависимость может появиться
(хорошо хоть я под баклофеном)

@artemarius352 Он каждый день делал передозировку ксанакса. Потому что любое успокоительное/энергическое/психотропное в передозировке влияет на Эйфорию и тот же эффект что и от наркотиков.  А умер он от паленого ксанакса, а не потому что съел больше чем положено.
в обычный день я бы уже завтракал в это время, а сейчас только пытаюсь заснуть. когда слишком привык к кветиапину.
Голова сегодня просто жесть, как болит.. Больничный продлили - конечно, по моему виду это уже логично, но самый треш был, когда я спорил о том, чтобы хотя бы до четверга, а на вопрос врача "курите" ответил "у меня только эутирокс в таблетках и кальций" *фп*
- Есть лишь один путь избавиться от таких сильных чувств - Ксанакс или мороженое?

Пить кветиапин днем это одновременно плюс и минус. Плюс - можно вставать рано утром и к десяти-одиннадцати все дела сделаны. Минус - если не встанешь рано утром, придется после короткого перерыва снова спать днем, просыпаться вечером, а там пару часов и снова спать.

Пусть себе засунут в очко свои объяснения.И поглубже.Они никому не интересны,как и сам ушибленный головой госдеп.Им уже и прозак не помогает

Дедушка Мороз, уже декабрь, поэтому я пишу тебе письмо - подари мне, пожалуйста, запас флуоксетина на год, с учётом того, что я жару по 4 таблетки в день, спасибо!
Если принимаешь флуоксетин-это он. Аппетит гораздо меньше, вернее хочется есть лишь что-то такое эдакое) и редко
К госврачу и пить флуоксетин
пароксетин начал действовать ну что же
паксил + жара = паническая атака
Как же мне хуево, господь.  Пароксетин, сука, напоминаю, что ты блять ебучий антидепрессат, ты обязан был сделать мне МЕНЕЕ ХУЁВО, А НЕ БОЛЕЕ ХУЁВО.
10 таблеток ксанакса водкой запить - вот это оргазм.

У меня флуоксетин, у подруги кветиапин, у другой сертралин
Запить флуоксетин энергетиком перед экзаменом было плохой идеей
Баклофен! реально прет или чушь?
забудь Ципрофлоксацин уже вышел из рекомендаций, к нему устойчивость до 30%
Да оттуда что если диарея продолжается свыше 2 суток и ваш хваленый лоперамид (фуфло кстати полное) не помогает, то не надо звать барана с дипломом чтобы понять что это заражение
Прозак: постоянно хочется жрать, снятся глючные сны, трясутся руки, голова в тумане. Ципралекс: вечный токсикоз и бессонница, венфлаксин: вообще зачем, по эффекту сравним с аскорбинкой.
Им нужен Сеалекс чтоб надолго хватало
Сегодня во сне жрал ксанакс и меня плющило
Да у них и прозак (продеп, флуоксетин) распространен, но у него полочки тяжёлые очень. Хотя на нем да, охуенно
@skellonis давай тебя будут звать Фенотропил, а меня Дулоксетин
Хочу кофе с коньяком, мне прям мегахуёво, несмотря на двойную дозу ламотриджина.
Ещё одна охуенная новость: пароксетин и лоразепам кончились а денег нет.  Остались только мы с тобой, клон.
кветиапин с чтением это не очень сочетание, 0/10, никому не рекомендую
@kurilov2004 @AllaUkraine2015 А вы точно журналист ?  Вы начали про тамифлю. Я вам показал, что это пустословие. Вы упорно не хотите признать ошибку. Это стыдно. И непозволительно в такой профессии.
надеюсь сокращение длительности симптомов на 16 часов это именно тот эффект, которого ты ожидаешь от этого препарата, ведь именно такие результаты указаны в метаанализе исследований по Осельтамивиру
Блять опять самый тупой из сисадминов взялся за мою заявку и все поломал. Уровень адекватности «паша-техник», будто вечно на ксанаксе, недавно по-дебильному засмеялся, увидев меня в зеленом поло и синих шортах, говорит, на футбольную форму похоже, не знаю, правда, какой страны..
Возможно так как не один человек который употребляет знает что мешать нельзя и там передоз был от 12таблеток ксанакса (норма употребляющих Ксанакс 6)
Лучше пусть от пыльцы придумают. Сальбутамол слабоват
Хочется напиться паксила чтобы не чувствовать отвращение от того что я ничего не чувствую Пачка лежит пропадает
если есть ингалятор, то воспользуйся им, н-р сальбутамол, беродуал игн
К черту детские игрушки. Паксил. Всё остальное для слюнтяев.
На мой взгляд, мало. Нет сосудосуживающего, противоотечного. Пульмикорта значит недостаточно в ингаляции. И нет антибиотика. Я бы, не задумываясь, добавила уже.
@Tim_Gadget ну теперь цифран где-то 130грн. + трихопол примерно 25грн. Может подорожало.
Автопилот по трассе, невозмутимо.  Я всегда сплю на матрасе флуоксетина.
Можно ли детям лоперамид: опасность при применении
Тамушо все думали, что ты и так это знаешь :) Все же знают. Но на меня действует только назарел в спрее.
Психотерапевт выписала мне другую противотревожку, можно слезать с ксанакса!
Это все просто снимает симптомы. Вирус побеждает только тамифлю. Правда, он не дешёвый((( Или наш Ингавирин. Температура 39?
действие сиофора через 3 месяца #bored #sun  #likeforlike
вообще паршиво себя чувствую, сонно и слабо. Буду просить, чтобы мне заменили антидепрессанты, флуоксетин явно слабоват, даже 3 таблетки в сутки.
@gandapas Радислав, здравствуйте! Помню, прошлом году искали дочке Тамифлю. Нашли. Насколько заметен был результат приёма?

Мммм прозак как я скучала ммм
@NikySHARP @Snejiko_83 за паксил не знаю ничего но один знакомый там стал зависимым от прозака до практически цветущего, но совершенно растительного состояния
@s_mind Не надо пить 5-htp без предписания врача. Эти таблетки воздействуют на один конкретный нейромедиатр, а нарушения могут быть в других -htp медиаторах. И дело может быть вообще не в серотонине. Сходи к врачу уже. Мне вот ни 5-htp не помогает и Прозак противопоказан.
На приеме назначили Ципролет в таблетках, Мукалтин, Бромгексин, мазь Доктор Мом и Эуфиллин
она умерла от ксанакса, клянусь еврейским носом жидка оксимирона.
@powerofeyebrows Ну, вот мне первую неделю написали по полтаблетки пить, дальше по одной. А чо с оланзапином помимо сонливости?  Так я вообще не особо разбираюсь в этом всем и боюсь их адски
Спасибо мирозданию за вентолин. Я хз уже че делать со своим кашлем. Ну, есть пару вариантов, например попасть к пульмонологу, к которому меня направили почти год назад или попытаться хотя бы меньше курить, но с вентолином как-то все равно проще
пол года метформина в пустую просто вот наааайс
Говорю так не потому, что она вписала мне баклофен)))
Очень круто что здесь мне не могут выписать сомнол и ксанакс нужны пРоВеРкИ зай а то что у тебя на руках справка что я в психушках лежала ниче не говорит???эх где мой краснодарский рыжий мужчина который за красивые глазки выписывал всё
вот не надо тут. ещё потом сдохнешь в 21. От ксанакса
да, давайте расскажу эту ахуительную историю.   пару месяцев назад бабуле выписали новые таблетки. ей от них стало хуже, в итоге она их то отменяла, то снова пила.   что это были за таблетки? флуоксетин, блять. отличная идея пить антидепрессант как попало 👌🏻
Отвратительно, у меня такое от прозака бывает только, но я же не под нииим
если ты чем-то недоволен, возьми себе ксанакса или барбитуры какой-нибудь жесткой
Сейчас, благодаря родственникам у меня сдали нервы и я начал уебывать баклосан, составляя цели попунктно. Первую цель я выполнил.
если ты чем-то недоволен - возьми ксанакса(с)
Я за ЛГБТ:   Л - ламотриджин  Г - галоперидол  Б - баклофен  Т - трамадол
Прошлась по всем ближайшим аптекам, нигде не было ламотриджина. В одной был за 1938 р. Я от безысходности собиралась его купить. И случайно наткнулась на другую аптеку, которую не показал гуглмэпс. Там был ламотриджин за 483. Я чуть не заплатила в 4 раза больше. В ЧЕТЫРЕ. Пиздец.
отсутствие паксила даёт о себе знать :)))
Просто в аптеках ксанакса нет
Увидела таблетки "розистарк". Хотела пошутить про дочь Тони Старка, но потом вспомнила, что её зовут Морган *неловкая пауза*
Блин, вот как так выходит, что стоит мне проглотить таблетку флуоксетина, как тут же прихожу в норму и ничего не беспокоит

тамифлю вызывает нарушение функций почек
В меня вошёл паксил, и я почувствовала как нервы отступили . Впервые такой моментальный эффект .
Баклофен. "Нихуя себе! Парам-пам-пам!" Они внатуре берегов не видят. Ну хоть поржать с них можно.
Новопассит Афобазол А вообще, мне ничерта из этого не помогало, но эт я. Человек, на которого уже транквилизатор грандаксин не действует. Живу на флуоксетине
@seriousprawn Велафакс (венлафаксин) Я не уверена, что это вообще не самовнушение, уж очень слабо верится в то, что малейшее падение уровня вещества, набранного месяцами приёма так роняет сразу
Венлаксор - вы не чувствуете как вам хуево и больно , вы просто это знаете .
@serge_coolikov @nalilovomshare Есть кстати момент, что нервы усугубляют Но как не нервничать, тем более когда начинаешь испытывать дискомфорт в отсутствии кислорода. Короче на улицу без сальбутамола ингалятора не выхожу 😔 Пару раз очень круто помог и верю в него как дети в деда мороза, наверное это и помогает
Блин, да даже от отмены флуоксетина ломает, представляю((( Единственное, от отмены чего меня не ломало - почему-то Велаксин. Он чудесный, мягкий, очень хорошо меня чинил, но, к сожалению, я о него, пардон, блевала дальше, чем видела.

Спросите про триттико - это не самый эффективный АД, но он наоборот повышает либидо.
Вы не понимаете, что спортсмены зарабатывают эту астму бегая каждый день на холоде? Александр Легков занимался спортом с 12, в 29 ему поставили астму, в 31 он взял золото. И не взял бы без сальбутамола, он бы просто задохнулся на трассе.
Кодтерпин, систазол, спазмолекс. Мелаксен, донармил , баклофен. Кодоксим , бензилморфин , псилоцибин -все как бывшая девочка.Довольно. Стопэ

@askroht Орин, у меня чутка серьёзнее, чем просто аллергический приступ, я ж астматик :с Эуфилин мне прописывали давненько, но он не помогал от слова совсем, поэтому оставили на сальбутамоле и ингаляциях. И я как бы не жалуюсь, но побочка от этого всего дикая ._.

ухухухху мне внезапно перепал рецепт на 60 таблеток паксила! осталось найти деньги и может быть я заживу.
ещё варианты: ксенофонт, ксенон, ксанакс, ксенофилия, ксенофилиус лавгуд
Слушай, а ты на финлепсине не спишь? Меня он просто ужасно срубает. Вот промазин + финлепсин = спать ночь, а то же + кветиапин = проспать 15-18 часов.
-забудь о водниках, только косяки *пошло 2 дня* -что ты делаешь? -водник -??????? -ну ты же хотела *осуждающе смотрит*  Пришлось опустить ведро, а во мне ксанакс и пиво..памагити
нп XS Project – Фен Баклофен  просто пиздец зачем я это слушаю
А можно ещё какой-нибудь жосткий препарат (типа флуоксетин или антидепрессант какой) в рамках акции продавать без рецепта, верно?))
@ilhouse @Senecarus @Arina_Chagal Метформин - лишь один из вариантов. Самый сильный.  Но есть те, кому он не идет..
олег хочет помочь мне достать ксанакс но прикол в том что это сделать спокойно я смогу сама но я не хочу идти к психотерапевту потому что за месяц я очень не взлюбила её и вообще мнение кардинально изменилось после того как мне рассказали как должны работать "правильные" врачи
@masha_kup здароооов! Глюкофаж знаешь? Глянь в группе Джесс.
Представляю, это тоже добавляет страха, что нет никакого стопроцентного средства, от которого не будет зависимости или которое не перестанет действовать. Самой было страшно начинать пить ксанакс год назад :(
Считаю, что команде следует принимать Лоперамид: это больше укрепит, чем покупка Бендтнера
Сибутрамин - офигенная вещь. С него ни есть не хочется, ни жить.
Тут кароче оказывается что от сальбутамола можно словить трип. Эта штука легальна и стоит 100-200 рублей.
Мне не нужны надоедливые шлюшки, хвастающиеся, как круто они готовят. Мне нужены те, кто будет голодать со мной и делиться флуоксетином
Я сижу и плачу это реальная угроза моей жизни, я сейчас не шучу, я абсолютно серьёзно. Мне помогает только большой ингалятор. А сальбутамол нет. Если в школе станет плохо (а от такого кашля точно станет), то мне придётся вызывать скорую.
Какой «нормальный» врач выписывает флу при ОКР? Когда столько хороших препаратов без таких ебанутых побочек, как у флуоксетина.

Сьела 100мг кветиапина и проснулась в час дня с вопросом: ГДЕ Я БЛЯДЬ ВООБЩЕ Я ВЫЛЕТАЮ ИЗ ТЕЛА ВНИМАНИЕ ВСЕМ ПОСТАМ Я НЕ ПОНИМАЮ ЧТО Я ТАКОЕ
снилось,что обнаружил лишнюю пачку флуоксетина и чувак,которого я бил по лицу налимом.и у всего у этого было ощущение праздника.
Угадайте, что сказал британский победитель "Тур день Франс" о своей положительной допинг пробе? Правильно - у него астма: "Хорошо известно, что у меня астма, я использую сальбутамол в разрешённых количествах и готов к каждодневным проверкам".
У меня когда-нибудь утро начнётся с кофе? Вчера один ксанакса обожрался во имя любви, сегодня у второго баба беременная, ЧТО ЗАВТРА БУДЕТ
в приемном отделении психиатрической клиники по телевизору показывают про то, что сша проводили эксперименты над людьми в грузии. узнал я об этом через полчаса после начала синдрома отмены прозака  я никуда не ложусь, прозак просто забыл купить, но приключение пиздец получилось
Здравствуйте, мне Прозак, паксил и чипсы с крабом.
5 мг феназепама и таблетка пароксетина. ну полегчай же
Ой перепутала - ламиктал, анафранил, флюанксол, тералиджен
и мне нахуй нужен ксанакс когда есть прегабалин
А остальные 20% что депрессия - это хандра, ну максимум легальная наркота (прозак или как там его).
Не, ну может немного пунша можно с прозаком - нет, нельзя, ты на прозаке Может, ёбнуть энергетика - нет, нельзя, ты на бетаблокаторах
Тошнит пиздос Скучала по тошниловке еще с флуоксетина
Так его с литием или ламотриджином совместно назначают. Костыль, конечно, но риски оправданные, если речь о том, что человек может руки на себя наложить
фликсоназе тоже хоть как-то спасает, но он же нихуя не 24 часадействует, как написано на обложке. при приёме в 9 утра, часов в 5 утра на следующий день ты уже несвеж и не светел и захлёбываешься соплями
@77DVD77 @noermitage_cats @sd0107 очень верное решение. К дексаметазону надо ещё вентолин добавить. В случае развития отека квинке поможет
слабовато. мне вот велаксин назначили. который на основе амфетамина, хех мда. вообще бодрый и веселый
Сейчас поведаю вам историю о наивной девочке, которая надеялась, что спасётся Альгерикой от ночных кошмаров.
Лента, кому-нибудь нужен флуоксетин? Меня пересадили на другие колёса, и осталось три пачки, из которых выпито только две таблетки (ещё есть полпачки ламиктала, также ставшего ненужным) Отдам безвозмездно то есть даром
Здраво. Но это если снотворные именно. Есть же и другие препараты со снотворным действием. Иногда приходится и на несколько месяцев на них присесть, чтобы хотя бы как то спать, особенно на фоне того же прозака.
споко ще умре скоро. Пия ксанакса и лягай
вы в курсе, что такое астма вообще? это не сломанная нога. в легкой форме это значит, что нужно сделать один глоток, например, вентолина, и вы дышите нормально следующие 24 часа. очкарики в очках, астматики с ингаляторами. астма - это не инвалидность.
Одно время прозак был весьма популярен. Психологи оч любили его прописывать. Теперь медицинский ганжабас!
Огосподи, кто еще настолько убого сидит на флуоксетине будто на герыче и делает из мухи слона?  Пиздец, а чё в театральный не поступили?
все ещё как на прозаке, как перед океаном на закате, как сытый вампир
А, и еще потому что "Биопарокс" - торговая марка, а "метопролол" - действующее вещество. Для "фузафунгина" исследований побольше, чем для биопарокса, хотя до метопролола не дотягивает по уже указанным причинам.
Был в Чехии осенью. Насмотрелся на рекламу, не поверите, Тамифлю

@SilverBro17 @zapilka Если это грипп - то тамифлю. Есть и другие противовирусные. Погугли
Про таблетку это про меня. Щитовидка сдохла от прогулок по Семипалатинскому полигону. Эутирокс пожизненно. Порой забываю. :)
Комплимент от астматика:  - ты мой флексотид,  ты мой вентолин,  помогаешь дыхать как ингалятор:3  да я ору с самой себя камон это норма
кидаю в инвалида яблоком  я под ксанаксом

шапки — святое! для всего остального есть тамифлю
Ну анализы показывают 20 единиц вместо 6. А от Сиофора ночью сердце болит. При этом цифры глюкоза / инсулинорезистентность не меняются особо
хочу снова начать принимать ксанакс и перкосет. если мое депрессивное состояние возвращается, то хули, давайте вернем и наркотическую зависимость.
бля ребят придумал себе идеальную смерть: при астматическом статусе дознуться сальбутамолом
@krodetcya сейчас в порядке спасибо в моменты сезона на сезон (первые/последние месяцы) я не могу дышать из за спазмов которые начинаются на фоне чего угодно (нервов занятия спортом быстро отдышки) помогает только вентолин и ингаляционные процедуры в больнице
Щас буду мешать флуоксетин с алкоголем потом расскажу как оно
Я после курса рексетина так себя чувствую. Чудесное ощущение
@News_krsk да пусть пьют, если ума нету. просто в аптеки завести побольше Лоперамида.
Сибутрамин-моя любовь, я б на нем всю жизнь сидела)))
С тех пор как я начала пить метформин - жизнь изменилась к лучшему. Несмотря на интригующее название, это лекарство влияет на выработку инсулина. Но хотя бы выяснилось, что что часть моего упадка сил были именно из-за эндокринных причин, а не из-за того, что в голове.

С утра стояла в очереди в аптеку за дядечкой, покупавшим сеалекс, и грустно, и потешно.
с вожделением думаю о прозаке
Я пью Метаквалон 15 раз в день, чтобы "спина не болела". Адрал, чтобы быть в фокусе. Ксанакс, чтобы снять напряг. Травку, чтобы уснуть. Кокаин, чтобы проснуться. И Морфин, ну, потому что он вкусный
Бананы содержат натуральный химикат, который делает человека счастливым. Тот же химикат, что и у Прозака.
А вообще, Я сегодня сама доброта. 15мг прозака делают свое дело волшебно
нет же, я люблю чачу.  ух ты, я в первый раз сказал, что что-то люблю. кроме прозака
Ну и кто ты без своего Конвалиса?
ой ща бы сальбутамол бестолково назначать и черкать весь уирс, нах, спать пойду

Проверка антидепрессанта в крови Нужен совет. Я, якобы, принимаю антидепрессанты [Венлафаксин] и скоро буду сдавать кровь врачу, который может выявить, правда ли я их принимаю (может быть еще мочу посмотрит, но это врядли). Я их на самом деле не приним
Также, что касается препарата метформин (для лечения СД 2 типа). Лучше брать оригинальный Глюкофаж(Франция),чем дженерики. Они хуже работают
Трагическая смерть флуоксетина в пучинах темных вод.
Лол, начни принимать кветиапин и будешь думать только о том, КАК БОЛИТ ГРЕБАНОЕ ТЕЛО :(
прозак закончился. флуоксетин (даже немецкий) вызывает головные боли. я говорила, что ненавижу дженерики? я ненавижу дженерики.
Ну вот и зачем я выпила кветиапин, теперь я хочу спать и не могу читать методичку с разборами
для начала перейду с одной таблетки прозака на две
А прозак на перерегистрации! Зато есть российский аналог за 88 рублей, в 4 раза дешевле, побочных эффектов в 4 раза больше, и работает в 4 раза хуже! Вот оно - #импортозамещение
весела жизнь на эутироксе, ух
Купить лекарство Лефлобакт Форте в аптеке -
ну или Тамифлю в самом начале, тогда к утру здоров. Или бессимптомно дня 3-4, если крепкий вирус.
@anelechkaa прозаком убьешь и осенний депр и желание жрать!)
Прямой курс на флуоксетин. Шутка, но у меня такой упадок сил, что уже третий день заставляю себя выйти в аптеку за витаминами. И не могу.
все говорят, что это почти у всех, кто пьёт кветиапин и у многих ещё дикий жор. я,конечно, хочу есть, но не так чтобы пиздец
Так. Невролог назначила флуоксетин для контроля аппетита и настроения, потому что я имела неосторожность сказать про эпизоды утомляемости и упадка сил. Жрать я и без него не хочу и опасаюсь побочек. Хочу жить в лесу и лечиться ягодами и корой, короче.
Я вот думаю ОК или Новаринг?  Новаринг или ОК?   Блять.
Пароксетин тоже пила, но недолго (мне его выписывали потому что он бесплатный был по месту жительства) и абсолютно хз, на тот момент была ни жива, ни мертва, может если бы пила дольше, было бы ок.
Хочу на ламотриджин блять Потому что мой нормотимик глушит мании и гипомании, а при депрессивных фазах - толку как от мела Ламотриджин, в свою очередь, глушит эффективен при депре Я понимаю, что гипомания - тоже нездоровая хуйня, но я в ней безмерно продуктивна

@Tezska1 Я читала, что споры по поводу пользы Тамифлю, зашли в тупик.
Вот например кофеин дает улучшение концентрации, повышает бдительность, но не дает поощрения. Поэтому, несмотря на то, что в тестах, например, аддерал, модафинил, кофеин показывает очень похожие результаты.
совсем забыла что если выпить венлафаксин во время тревожного эпизода, то обязательно получишь в подарок паническую атаку
обожаю это чувство когда хуебесит от флуоксетина

Только представь. Ты. Я. Между нами горячий беляш с вокзала. Впереди 3 часа путешествия по железной дороге. Ты немного переживаешь. Не волнуйся, милая, у меня с собой пачка лоперамида.
Так, меня вроде немного попустило, но завтра придётся всё равно дохуя прегабалина сожрать, чтоб не подохнуть от охуения и неумения говорить
А я голову ломала, от чего это всё, оказывается сероквель виноват
В итоге с миртазапина действительно потолстел. И это несмотря на утренние тренировки, довольно активный образ жизни и параллельный прозак, на котором худеют.
Ребята, пожалуйста, не пейти антибиотики, если у вас «что-то типо гриппа». Если реально подозрение на грипп - тамифлю в первые двое суток и симптоматически парацетамол от температуры, брызгать горло и пить морс

Этот человек я, помогли мне терапевт и прозак (оба пока в прошлом), но, как обычно, есть нюансы. В плане работы реально лучше стало, хотя иногда мне и кажется, что я занимаюсь ерундой. В плане всего остального — ну, день на день не приходится.
Для диабетиков используют Глюкофаж Лонг, но без консультаций и прочего не советую его жрать. Волшебных таблеток для похудения не бывает, и адипоциты при похудении не пропадают в никуда, из них уходит жир, но их количество остаётся неизменным. Только РП и активность.
10 упаковок флуоксетина, около 30 различных сиропов от кашля, но ни одного, сука, парацетамола какого-то
Ладно, японел 😂 по чужим твиттерам можно без опаски ходить только под пароксетином 😂
А я тут опять свои антидепрессанты жру ))) Рисперидон, пароксин, флуоксетин, КАК ЖЕ Я СКУЧАЛА

Я перепробовал штук 5 разных антидепрессантов, самые дорогие из них мне не помогали вообще, зато, как ни смешно, лучше всего работали самые дешевые. Правда, от одних из них были побочки на печень и постоянная горечь во рту, и в итоге я перешел на печально известный флуоксетин.
надо в срочном порядке начинать закидываться флуоксетином
Когда я пробовал принимать флуоксетин, где-то на третий день сработал так называемый активирующий эффект. Это было круче любых наркотиков, я был просто счастлив, как никогда счастлив. Был на небе. Потом прошло. Завидую всем этим жизнерадостным оптимистам, знаю какого им.
я ненавижу пить ебаный полисорб и фликсоназе  но пожалуйста, хоть бы они щас помогли и я не сдохла
Надо: всяко рыльское бильжо вывалить навалом - обработать колом в Жо - чтоб не казалось мало! А после выдать им имодиум и вывести на подиум
лучше обойтись половиной бутылки! если много ебошить на паксиле могут быть симптомы передозировки. хочешь много пить - переходи на венлу или золофт, хаха
Обязательно! В Москве как были перебои с тем же глиформином - так и есть!
кстати если (какое если тебе рецепт уже выписали пиздуй) я начну курс  ламотриджина (если я его найду блин) мне придется не пить пиво и прочие спиртные напитки и мне неловко признаваться что меня это пиздец как расстраивает
Кто знает можно смешивать ибупрофен с флуоксетином??

Бля, тоже хочу кататься по больнице и кормить ветеранов ксанаксом и поить кодеином
Крепит лоперамид когда у тебя диарея, а Путин укрепляет.
@naninumo помню ты раньше триттико пила. у меня зависимость уже какая-то от этих таблеток. амитриптилин в основном,а так то лошадиная доза гидазепама на ночь. просто не хочу пить нейролептики
удивляюсь, еще не встречал мнения, что для русского человека тоска - абсолютно притягательна, а американец не выдерживает и склонен к приему ксанакса чуть что или суициду.
кул, однажды принимал его под названием Триттико, эффект был отличный. Но когда принимал в другой раз через несколько месяцев, ничего не почувствовал.
Ну я алпразолам как-то запивал
Фенибут+творчество=хорошо  Флуоксетин+творчество=не работает, несовестимо вообще
@Tatyana_AA выдернули из дома:( не с собой:( может слышала про 'таваник'

Музыка у него была не менее плохой, первый в мире эмо рэп, от ксанакса умер или от пули, какая разница?
@Vremya_Pokazhet из США спортсмены сидят на допинге у них СДВГ,Норвежцы на сальбутамоле,у них астма,всем врачи разрешили,что за спорт такой ущербный
Последствия длительного употребления ксанакса ужасают
@wrstsnnr Велаксин ужасная мерзость. Я тоже на нем сидела. На него сложно садиться и смерти подобно слезать. Нах ее вообще прописывать?
наверное, от велаксина худеют тупо потому что есть, когда тебя так тошнит, просто невозможно (но я не против, ибо с первого раза же почувствовала себя лучше)
Я на паксиле и от двух бутылок пива и половины вина вроде было норм,только немного трясло
@Lena__FM @bldthrstbtwhl В своё время порылась. Есть только два противовирусных, которые доказали свою клиническую эффективность — тамифлю и реленза. При условии, что пьёшь в первые 48 часов симптомов, и это лишь помогает сократить время болезни (не 7, а 5 дней) и снизить субъективный дискомфорт. Цена🙈
Сегодня ночью мне приснился Паша Техник, который угощал меня "Ксанаксом". Интересно, что об этом говорят сонники.
@Bubbl_Bitch Кушал паксил года 4. Не представляю как бы функционировал без него. Помог социализироваться и улучшить качество жизни. Получил от препарата все что нужно и я его бросил. Пару месяцев конечно было тяжеловато, но я бы не назвал это привыканием. Сейчас не тянет  его принимать.
никто не хочет случайно купить мне флуоксетин и поадить его на нг?
Я БЫЛ ПОД КСАНАКСОМ , ЭТО НЕ В СЧЕТ
лучший способ слезть с флуоксетина - попасть в реанимацию с серотониновым синдромом))) зато эффективно

Каламбуры с названием, серьёзно? Одиум, подиум, имодиум
Обычно прописывают метформин. Почитайте аннотации, но это строго по назначению врача.
В тайланде со мной было тоже самое.Я лопала церукал. прям не глотала а рассасывала, чтобы не тошнило. И Лоперамид.
@AlexxScorpion Ну у меня короче план после всего прочитанного, что совмещается и когда пить)Циклоферон до еды за полчаса, потом поесть и диазолин.Если через пару-тройку часов не станет лучше,то лактофильтрум и через час поесть и цифран.. Реально вспомнила универ, когда одно цепляется за другое
Я готова писать это каждый ебаный день пока я принимаю ципрофлоксацин. К ЕГО ГОРЕЧИ ЖИЗНЬ МЕНЯ НЕ ГОТОВИЛА!
@mahariuse @Tashevich Потому он всё-таки работает, но не даёт такого серьёзного эффекта, как у астматиков. А в спорте высоких достижений решают секунды. Но поверь, тебе сальбутамол не поможет бежать по 3:12.

про СИОЗС (флуоксетин, рексетин, прочая хуйня) - абсолютно то же самое, просто ну их нахуй. и отходняки с них как-то совсем не в радость, а на отмене можно забавную побочку словить, к-рая проявится в усилении суицидальных мыслей, падении либидо и прочих радостей жысти. потому да.
Ну в смысле что это препарат продающиеся по рецепту врача, также как и оксикодон. Конечно люди и на них присаживаются, но при желании можно и мускатным орехом упарываться.

Какого хрена я уснула в 2:55, а проснулась в 6:50?! У меня сегодня съёмка, я должна быть свежа и бодра. Как уснуть обратно? Где купить кветиапин? Без регистрации и смс. #недоброеутро
15. мне прописали ламотриджин, но я не рискнула его пить во время сессии, а затем во время отпуска, потому что уже насмотрелась на побочки.  но пару дней назад я начала пить его снова, потому что гипомания кончилась и начался новый депрессивный эпизод.

Выпила Ксанакса и отрубилась. 2 часа спустя проснуласт рывком, с уверенностью, что утро.
К середине июня мне было уже так хуево, что мозгоправы мне прописали:  - эсциталопрам - феназепам - габапентин - цитиколин - овердохуя витаминок для мозга  От такого охуел ещё больше, и, всё-таки, подумал: может быть, ещё одна попытка выжить без этого всего?  И у меня получилось.
Сальбутамол не помогает, это как если человека под дождём пытаться высушить феном. Надеюсь, что вода и ветерок и облачка мне помогут
@v_tretyakov Послать им гуманитарку - каждом жителю  по 2 таблетки Лоперамида и не жрать сутки. А уголь,чтоб желудки промыть можно наш с Донбасса,пусть жуют и не дохнут

Наебнула с утра 60мг пароксетина и радуюсь жизни
О, как раз вчера Ципролет допила.
а от ксанакса можно сдохнуть?
Я люблю пробовать всякую дичь. Я как-то попробовала паксил, его девочки прописывали для сна, а меня от него штырило как от фена
Это я ещё не под ксанаксом
Конечно, в лечении должны использоваться нейролептики («Сонапакс», «Лепонекс», «Флюанксол»,»Хлорпротиксен», «Аминазин», «Галоперидол») в комплексном сочетании с  антидепрессантами («Амитриптилин», «Азафен», «Прозак», «Флуоксетин», «Паксил», «Тразодон»).
@tyotya8813 На данный момент круче «тамифлю» ничего не придумали.  Из всех существующих, он один на свиной действует.
а ты случайно не сидишь на прозаке?
не выдержал, съел сегодня полтаблетки паксила, совсем другой человек стал, почему всегда так нельзя
пантопразол, рабепразол, эзомепразол в лодке не считая собаки
аддерал запрещен, и пр нейростимуляторы в шахматах и киберспорте.
@MEXAHNKA кветиапин и седалит феназ же нельзя, особенно если депра, он её усиливает

@powerpuffluvv фосфалюгель, тримедат, нексиум, эманера, маалокс остальные не помню, пила их в начале лечения
Ну вот паксил той же группы, и он в целом бодрящий. Ещё есть феварин, который мне с теми же жалобами прописывали, но мне он был совсем никак.
у меня знакомая флуоксетин пивасом запивала))0)

Когда будешь в аптеке узнай для меня цену на ципрофлоксацин в ампулах и таблетках. Не знаю стоит покупать в Днепре. Не срочно.
намиксовал ксанакса и рогипнола, ваще заебись
@blobglobster Если не переборщить, то с флуоксетином вообще очень даже норм, только есть риск сильнее наклюкаться. Приучает к чувству меры) Но это все очень индивидуально, мне видимо прост повезло. Ну или организм уже проспиртованный ггг
Зачем мне ксанакс, меня успокоит депрессия  Зачем мне лсд, если у меня шиза

господи, храни пароксетин 50 мг в сутки. уже второй день я почти что не против жить
А от сероквеля как? Мне уже впору написать огромный том о его хуевости по отзывам
посмотрела утром в упаковку с оланзапином. не нашла таблеток. думаю, ладно, лень за ним идти, один денёк обойдусь без нейролептика. сейчас смотрю в пачку, а там целый блистер неначатый лежит. просто одна эмоция:
Хиккой я хиккую Хайпами хайпую Фрустрацией фруструю Паксилом я паксую
сожрала 1/2 атаракса и 1/4 пароксетина; успокоилась, выпила воды, пропшикала горло (все бесполезно, к слову, за день оно так ни разу и не прошло)  охуительная ночь вышла, надеюсь, хоть сейчас засну

Кветиапин канон 25мг. Доступность: 9/10, чуть дороже сз, но цена норм. Действие: 10/10. Побочки: 8/10. На самом деле, это спорно, ибо снизил за то, что вырубает МГНОВЕННО. С непривычки можно не успеть дойти до кровати и уснуть на толчке. А так норм, рекомендую, если нет денег
Между тем мой луноликий купил мне последнюю упаковку кветиапина в аптеке (поэтому и на 300 мг), и теперь я торчу ему 2700 рублей, а у меня только 2000. Если вы мне от души подкинете деньжат (хотя бы сотку) – будет охуенно.

иногда моя речь под таблетками становится схожей с Пашей Техником под ксанаксом
Я думала, что флуоксетин старый препарат и не поможет ни капли, но я ошиблась. Я стала намного лучше себя чувствовать. Уменьшилась тревожность, перестало настроение скакать. Единственный минус - это побочка со снижением аппетита.

#fitburn Отзывы худеющих о препарате «Сиофор 850»  Процесс похудения не из быстрых и требует особых навыков терпения и целеустремленности. Обычно лишний вес сбрасывают за счет комплексных диет и физических нагрузок.  https://t.co/fHfIf1fZJ1
флуоксетин дороже! (но и помогает лучше)
Паша техник поет что он против наркотиков против ксанакса, что вообще происходит?
.@MINZDRAV_RF намерен запретить продажу прегабалина, тапентадола и тропикамида. За сбыт будет штраф до 200 тысяч рублей и лишение свободы от трех до восьми лет. В общем куча людей останутся без доступа к жизненно важным для них препаратам @takiedelaru
я то уже понадеялся, что эффект флуоксетина будет круглосуточными. ;(
Хочется съесть все таблетки, что есть в пачке Рекситина. Но это чревато и глупо
Эфективность осельтамивира и занамивира fda признала как скромное. И разрешила заявлять по поводу ефективности только в лечении симптомов гриппа.
Разбирать все лекарства я не буду, потому что я с ними не знакома и надеюсь, что они мне не пригодятся. В сумке у меня всегда лежит Беродуал (сальбутамол) для снятия приступа и каждый месяц я покупаю турбухалер Симбикорт на 120 доз.
@Miytti_chan Та блин Я тут Ципрофлоксацин пью уже 5 день и ничего Вот думаю на антибиотики перейти со следующей недели  Сегодня вообще пик болезни Меня прям трясет и кости болят Думаю как бы не сдохнуть
Опять его поносит..дайте ему лоперамид
Метформин может предотвратить и лечить преэклампсию у беременных женщин  #Australia
ну и конечно можно тупо жрать бесконтрольно флуоксетин по классике (плз донт ду зыс)
@_NESTEROVICH @kosyakovaaa а. паксил хуйня. полгода его уже жру, ващ никаких изменений
почему от паксила ломит тело
Узнайте, что лучше для потенции: Визарсин или Силденафил, как правильно употреблять эти препараты и почему один лучше другого.
При Йуле было фсьо. Тамифлю,оксолиновая мазь, медицинские маски, ДТ, яйца,сахар,масло,мясо. Фсьо было дефицит
@xmbshwll киношная, не киношная всё равно документалка  да и Малик лишь продюсер, но я бы посмотрел, если бы он снимал  статичные шведские заснеженные пейзажи и россыпи ксанакса крупным планом
Подорожник прикладывай, ольгобот. Тамифлю 1200, дороговат для тебя.
Препарат Сиофор купить в Перми – описание и инструкция по применению лекарства «Сиофор» - заказать недорого в интернет аптеке на Apteka.ru
Принято мудрое решение: бокал вина, немножечко кветиапина и пара серий Смешариков
Сначала была Юля, а потом кое-кто поймал небольшой передоз от прозака.
@trevize72 А почему нельзя? В чем проблема. Сейчас астма не проблема. Принимай все препараты  и она будет в стадии ремиссии. У меня бронх астма, я и забыла когда были серьезн приступы. Сальбутамол в помощь))) Даже проф спортсмены есть астматики. Сейчас астма, как гастрит.
Всем привет я жива стала пить каждый день алко, жрать кучками габапентин и не жрать еду Итог: хожу объебаная с -10кг :)
@tanya_la_rina @lexusarh2009 @Dasssha2010 @XS_71 ну, наши вместо вентолина на ксенон подсели. :)
А что,сальбутамол дает силы? А я стараюсь не пользоваться.То то сил нет,знергии
Купила ципрофлоксацин. Наконец-то, я начну лечение
пойду за нормотимиком (пока ещё не ламотриджин но выпрошу к следующему месяцу) и вяленой рыбой предположительно таранью
Но чаще всего у меня ужасное настроение, как будто под ксанаксом
Противоэпилептическое средство "Прегабалин", обезболивающее "Тапентадол" и офтальмологический препарат "Тропикамид" включили в список В России ограничили оборот "аптечных наркотиков":
и сдерживает обещания. Правда подорожал, был 330. В инете цену посмотри. Если что, дам попробовать (10-15). Паксила (5)
Штош Работа Кому-то приносят конфеты и коньяк Со мной босс делится своим ксанаксом
Ре бя та! Стали продавать какой-то новый флуоксетин. Задалась целью испробовать.
Потому что это Россия, детка. И любой действительно хороший АД здесь стоит столько, что проще купить говенный флуоксетин и забить на свои проблемы.
В Челябинске любую наркоту проще достать, чем флуоксетин ланнахер, имея на руках рецепт на него!
особенно если он под ксанаксом
Я тоже его пытался пить, но что мёртвому припарка. Зато Флуоксетин меня вытаскивал медленно, но верно. А потом его стали по рецепту продавать.
Нажрался ксанакса и кошачьего корма и всё, нет человека!
@minzdrav__63 вопрос: входят ли Депакин Хроно и Ламиктал в перечень препаратов для бесплатного обеспечения пациентов по рецепту , и может ли пациент требовать оригинальный препарат , отказываясь от предлагаемого дженерика . Спасибо .место прикрепление пациента - ГП3 САМАРА .
сука ОХОТО срать жестко потому что траванулся сосисончиками но не встать потому что перекрыло с флуоксетина ещё сейчас от него же обкончаюсь а ещё немного на измене от крепкого кофе помогите пожалуйста хотя не надо мне вроде очень хорошо
однажды вика не смогла смотреть на меня и побочки от прозака,  поэтому подарила мне других колёс, – которые я усиленно избегала
Метформин может по-настоящему лечить диабет?
хочу закупиться энергетиками водой и несколькими коробками флуоксетина
Как же рядышком проходил пиздец - в булимическую юность мечтала найти флуоксетин, но обстоятельства меня спасли и я выросла без него чуточку цельнее и адекватнее
В левой руке Ксанакс, В правой руке Туссин. Мой пиар-менеджер — Прегабалин.
*закинулась ксанаксом, пошла варить кофе*
У меня вопрос. Мне советовали метформин для похудения пить (а-ля как антидепрессанты, которые имеют в побочках анорексигенный эффект). Я же права, что у здорового человека при приеме метформина может случиться диабет?
дааа ламотриджин + кветиапин ван лав
На голову упала коробка сальбутамола.. Да помню я, помню
Кстати. Хозяйкам на заметку. Если ввести в яндексе "прегабалин вк" вы узнаете как упарываются всякой хуетой с виду нормальные люди.
фенозепам по рецепту, от паксила эффекта не будет если ты его не принимаешь
но в кветиксоле действующее вещество - кветиапин как раз
Скажи что ты не телка какая чтобы визжать с визуалок и с чем то слабее оксикодона он может даже и не лезть к тебе
ой ладно,я в Бруклине учился,там лучшие школы это педагоги из бывшего СССР,в остальных реднековских мрак и прозак
судя по моей аптечке я очень больной пенсионер тут антибиотики противовирусные корвалол валосердин уголь парацетамол панкреатин фестал мотилиум лоперамид смекта хлоргексидин звёздочка супрастин коделак ибупрофен витамины дорогие таблетки для мозга и ещё куча всего  я живу одна
Страшно- это когда ломка от ксанакса и пресловутое "тебянехватание".
Пацаны, Че там по ксанаксу? Не разу не пробовал, где брать? Давайте пруф
А печень как после прозака?
Второй день на Прозаке, пока жива, панических атак нет. Уф. Нашла фик-мечту, Веном!АУ по 3 сезону Странных дел, все так же но только «паразит» Билли как Веном, и это очень весело.
Опять прочитала ужасную новость. Изымают Эреспал!!  Лечить астму и ХОБЛ теперь почти нечем. В глубинке нет ничего. Серетид раньше давали каждый месяц бесплатно. Теперь его нет в продаже. Астматики откликнитесь, как вы поддерживаете свое дыхание, чем снимаете приступы?Прошу ретвит
понятно. хороший недорогой антибиотик последнего поколения - азитромицин. хороший дорогой антибиотик - Таваник или цедекс.
СИОЗС вообще ни о чём имхо От прозака в дикую гипоманию уносило, плюс тревога пизда дрозда, ну и дереалы вплоть до галлюцинаций и потери памяти От пароксетина ушла тревога, но потом вернулась, депрессивную симптоматику особо и не убирал От флувоксамина я чуть не покончила с собой
Выпила одну таблетку флуоксетина ,ну че когда я стану анорексичкой ???
этого особо не был напряжен. Просто получал кайф* Однако, интересная реакция в эту минуту проходит в моем организме. То, что должно избавлять меня от тяги к наркотикам, сейчас борется с оксикодоном *хрипловато засмеялся, затем зарылся пальцами в мягкие волосы Алиссии*
Если ты на АД, то тразодон помогает
Прилив прозака! Или почему я не плачу уже минут 40
Спасибо, ципролет, лимон. А мёдом меня мама лечила, снаружи обмажет всего,ух и противно)бр, зато проходит всё быстро,ну а я внутрь.
Если вдруг врат ее пой тут что это то 12мг клоназепама 1500мг Кветиапин и американский ад 200мг
а друзьям на этой стадии уже бесполезно звонить, да и зачем других мучить? если сейчас норм, то хорошо и хорошо, что без таблеток! я вот их пить боюсь, потом это надо с рецептом заморачиваться. а так можно верить в волшебную силу прозака и его не пить
Смотрю Sky Sports. Перерыв. Где реклама "Аликапс"? Где "Сеалекс"??? Неужели в Англии у них проблем с "этим" нет - все стоит, как Биг Бен?!
- Я все ж віддаю перевагу 4-м колесам, ну нахуй ті мотоцикли. - А я за колёса флуоксетина. @axclever
Я ТАК БОЛЬШЕ НЕ МОГУ МНЕ ПЛОХО И КОГДА Я ПЬЮ ПРОЗАК И КОГДА Я ЕГО НЕ ПЬЮ Я НЕ ХОЧУ СДОХНУТЬ
мне нужны сигареты и возможно прозак  или флуокс что продадут но для начала нужны деньги
они только против симптомов. Чтобы завтра быть огурчиком надо противовирусный Тамифлю.
на прозак лет 20 уже как патент истек, по этому его кто угодно может производить, действующее вещество флуоксетин, средняя цена 150 рублей
форадил комби , очень хорошее средство
Немалый вклад в увеличение проблем с ростом хронических заболеваний и смертности внесло отсутствие с 2012 года препаратов с гормоном Т3 - Трийодтиронин. Всех щитовидных больных лечат только Т4 - тироксин,эутирокс, это приводит к тяжелым осложнениям!
UPD: Пульмикорт врач мне в ужасе отменила, поскольку "это же гормональное!!!" Как итог: мне снова хуже, но я уже не знаю, из-за отмены ли Пульмикорта, или нет. Улучшение было таким кратковременным, что как-будто и не было его вовсе. Начинаю хотеть умереть.
Лекарство: Отдам РЕАЛЬНО нуждающимся "прадакса" срок годности в норме. В коробке осталось 20 капсул.
когда блять пьешь гормоны щитовидной на которых люди теряют по 20 кг за полгода, а ты сука жирнеешь на глазах )0))0))) а еще блять пьешь ебаный флуоксетин, но все равно обжираешься каждый день как в последний раз
Сегодня у папы ДР и у нас тут праздничный стол  Кажется идея с флуоксетином и водой не такая уж и плохая
может кто-то из вас пил триттико?  😭 гидазепам больше не действует, даже большими дозами
У меня так от Венлафаксина и Хлорпротиксена было
Во мне пять бутылок водки ксанакс скитлз
мда што сказать поколение ксанакс уууууууууууууууу
вычитала на зарубежных сайтах, что антидепрессант, который я принимала(пароксетин) имеет самый долгий и тяжелый синдром отмены. и вообще депрессию нужно лечить рыбьим жиром
не работайте под ксанаксом, никогда
Кстати мужик из рекламы сеалекса сыграл хорошо.
чисто теперь я закидываюсь флуоксетином суки довели меня
крепко подсел на ксанакс и феназепам, лечу хроническую бессонницу, а так с месяца 2 назад в дурке отлежал, все норм
самое отвратительное что прозак не помогает больше и хоть врач и сказал мне что прозак пить долго оч хуево и я потеряю норм эмоции
Хочется ксанакс хавать а еще макдональдс и какать.
Вадим Радионов: Создатель «Тамифлю»: Вирусы — это высшее природное руководство https://t.co/7u1GPvFAux
Антибиотик норфлоксацин и я пила нимесил обезболивающее,бо сильно болел,и от частых походов в туалет лопедиум
Во мне три стакана молока сативы, сколько-то прегабалина сколько то гашиша, две рюмки кальвадоса и пол круга сибири. Не помню как ехал сюда
Весь последний месяц малодушно думаю, не нырнуть ли опять на кветиапин. После его отмены у меня полное чувство, что у меня выгуливать из черепной коробки все, что можно. Я хотела перестать его пить из-за гормонов и из-за того, что я не могла на нем сочинять тексты.
@888_cocaine На гидре разве есть аптека? Вообще я смотрела, но там только феназепам, ксанакс и только в больших количествах по почте или как то так🤷‍♀️ ну это в моем городе
Антидепрессанты с алкоголем, кстати, абсолютно непредсказуемо сочетаются. В основном всегда все норм было. Потом был велаксин, который в сочетании с алкоголем чудесно эээ чистил желудок. Сейчас, видимо, время трезвости - с двух бокалов я шальная императрица.
Нашла в старой сумке целую пачку флуоксетина. С 11.12.14 лежит, ого.
БЛЯТЬ точно, сегодня же мой праздник, день психически больных проведу романтический вечер с моим парнем по имени Флуоксетин💜💚💊💋
Я всегда с собой беру  Велаксин и зилаксеру
Вме мои парни на связиВсе мои парни без башни Им просали лирикуИм прописали xanax
Смотри ка, беспокойный какой, выпей прозак и позвони Нетаньяху, и всё пройдёт))))
я серьёзно, такая реакция у него эээ какая у меня была, когда адепресс пила
встала умыться, решила тип ща порисую. в голове шум, от прозака зевота сраная, перед глазами пятна. так и живем))
ещё с утра какая-то херня с дыхалкой. это стрёмно..ибо как-то преследует ощущение что моя астма проснулась..лет с 10 такого не было.. а если да,то привет "Вентолин"
Лето подходит к концу, на твоем конце только пару кредитов натянуто плотной резиной латекса, Паша давно не может спрыгнуть с ксанакса, а у тебя лето кончается, а у кого-то в больничной койке белой линией жизнь обрывается, цени то кажуал братка, что не имеет цены.
@Martisha5  У нас чаще всего Эгилок советуют, но он же по рецепту, а есть практически соседки-болтушки.
Флуоксетина и людиомил в горле уже стоит, не помогает
я купила всего лишь турбухалер и пшикалку в нос
А что сильней фенибута? Баклофен?
Не всегда мона лоперамид)при отравлениях низзя например)
Вышла на работу, давление сразу упало и начало тошнить от венлафаксина (или не от него). Сука ну спасибо.
@serbret981 Дорогой "славянин", от всей души желаю тебе никогда не узнать, что такое сальбутамол, а также астма, немозможность ДЫШАТЬ, корчи на полу БЕЗ ВОЗДУХА, когда кончился баллончик с сальбутамолом! Живи с миром. Это я тебе как спортсмен-любитель и астматик говорю.
Я без флуоксетина, как Эллиот без морфина.
это не эстетично и не прикольно — есть горстями прозак, флуоксетин или какие другие таблетки
Тамифлю , но судя по описанию при любом чихе им не стоит закидываться, отпускают только по рецепту
Из за ожидания результатов экзаменов сижу на таблетках И пока не на ксанаксе)))))
Повторение постмайданного времени. Держитесь, Юля уже готовится закупать Тамифлю и газ по 450.
твой псих точно дурак, он должен был тебе назначить схему слезания с паксила, даже мой это делает
БОЖЕ, ХРАНИ КВЕТИАПИН И ПСИХОТЕРАПИЮ
повезло еще и в том, что под прозаком можно в общем то продолжать пить, что, конечно, радует и не радует одновременно
Хорошо ,так :на кетилепте ,акинетоне ,велаксине . Хорошо три месяца без азалептинок ч аминазинкой.
Сейчас как плюну на завтрашние пары, обопьюсь кофейком, закинусь метопрололом и пойду смотреть стрим.
Была техником, вот только ксанакс мне так и не дали(((((
Фликсоназе либо Авамис,сними отек.Возможно у тебя аллергический ренит.
@ValeroGenia Тебантин, Трилептал, Ламиктал, Эглонил, Симбалтп, Церепро, Амитриптилин, Фенлепси, Фенотропил, Прозак, Триттико, Анафранил Галоперидол, Зилаксера, Трифтазин, Галоперидол. Но такое редко случается. Просто сегодня хочется выть волком и на стену лезть.
Напомните мне, с чего я вообще взяла, что это история про революцию?.. Два сезона прошло, а пока это была лишь история Феноменально Плохих Решений поразительно аморфных для дистопии людей. И тормозов, богиня, там все под Ксанаксом? Я все понимаю, саспенс туда-сюда, но бляяяять
Дают мне рецепт на цефалексин и просят дать ципрофлоксацин  Нормативные, вообще нет?
@KingNikkizz ммммммм щас бы флуоксетина 80мг и не есть пятьсот дней
чувство будто пытаюсь слезть с герыча а не с паксила
Чтоб вы знали, меня сейчас вызвали в отделение с жалобами на "одышка, затрудненное дыхание, задыхается", а на деле шести летнему пацану заложило нос, он дышал ртом, закашлял, проснулся, заплакал, а мама попросила врача, что бы я им на ПЕРЕСОХШЕЕ ГОРЛО ДАЛА ИНГАЛАЦИЮ ПУЛЬМИКОРТОМ
Когда выйдя на работу понимаешь, что от работы органически тошнит, единственное средство прийти в гармонию с собой - это лоперамид
Царвство морфия Объятия валиума Сонное царство Объятия ксанакса
ужас нет каждые пять минут приходит осознание что все ПАКЯ нахуй ты тут никому не сдалась и хочется зарыдать ааааа хочется заброситься кветиапином чтобы уснуть но я же пропущу все перелёты
Он как медик должен хорошо разбираться в различного рода препаратах и веществах, стимулирующих психику и нервную систему. Это может быть всё, что угодно, начиная от флуоксетина и заканчивая настойкой пиона
Хочешь быть величнее египетских пирамид? Дружок, принимай Лоперамид
Покупаем за свой счет виктозу. Бесплатные препараты лечащие эндокринологи всерьез не рассматривают.
Раньше ещё сеалекс был со Шнуром
Где мой метопролол, сердце заебало уже битый час колотиться на овер сотню, хотя я дома лежу пластом  Такая каша в башке от тревоги
@Kim_Chen_Un @ChehovMedved Тамифлю? спасибо, тоже, куплю, не применяла.., всё народными пользуюсь, зима впереди.
@Kotyaro4ka пульмикорт оч много она уже продышала, врач сказала больше нельзя пока, а то во вред пойдёт
Честно уже не помню. Но какой-то популярный. (Может Прозак, но это не точно.)
Бизнесвумен вместе с любовником задержали за сбыт опасного вещества сибутрамин. Пара из Челябинска попалась на продаже сибутрамина. Это вещество рекламируют как средство для похудения. Но на самом деле оно может серьезно
Бисопролол, кардиомагнил и метформин из моего ежедневного набора жизненно важных препаратов. Беру дорогие импортные дженерики.
Никто: Абсолютно никто: Второклассники из моей школы: "ТЕБЕ ЧТО БОЛЬШЕ НРАВИТЬСЯ КСАНАКС ИЛИ ФЕН??? Я ВОТ БОЛЬШЕ ПО ШИШКАМ"
пришла значит к новому психиатру - прозак мы тебе пока выписывать не будем, но ты не грусти НЕ ГРУСТИ БЛЯТЬ ДА ЧТО ВЫ И В МЫСЛЯХ НЕ БЫЛО
Я в последний год лечусь тамифлю и санорином (раньше была полидекса, но она не пошла)
привозит меня скорая вчера к инфекционисту, она выписывает таблетки мама: мы сейчас пьём флуоксетин и атаракс их можно совмещать с вашим лечением? и: по поводу? м: депрессия и тревога и: ХАХ ПФ ДЕПРЕССИЯ В 16 ЛЕТ??? У ВАС ДЕПРЕССИЯХ В 16 ЛЕТ?? ЛОЛ НАДО ИНЕТ ЕЙ ОТКЛЮЧИТЬ И ВСЁ
7. + если попробуешь флуоксетин, пизды отхватишь, серьёзно
кацудоньи пирожки, когда я уже куплю этот чертов ламотриджин
против воспалений я лично использую ципрофлоксацин (вещество) входит например в цифран. всегда читайте инструкции к препаратам)
Ну тя. Рашкинская «земля» — бегать по ночному неба учили. Но по эскалатору. Ты доля, ксанакса, и, пару друзей бате
сколько ксанакса то сожрать так надо ну пип
@nessakiprida Флуоксетин спустя месяц с начала приема. Эмоциональным овощем становишься
Ксанакс для слабаков. Настоящие мужики топят грусть в алкоголе.
Всего лишь второй день жру прозак, а уже солнышко в Москве ярко светить начало.
Пустая трата времени с ароматом Ксанакса
вообще пить таблетки без рецепта ну такое, там же, наверное, все индивидуально, я сказала, что на это на его усмотрение Он сказал, что тогда попробует и мне купить ( да это был ксанакс ) Мне еще болье нравилось ходить в библиотеку, ведь теперь там я чувствовала себя менее одиноко
И это не под прозаком ,охуительно!
Все так зависит от фармацевта. Вот снова мне не поставили в рецепт, что выдали АД. Я спокойно могу пойти и купить в другом месте ещё три упаковки. И ламотриджина ещё.
Пресвятой джигурда, и кто ж этот препарат запретил?! Сибутрамин - это лекарство от ожирения. И, он никем не запрещён в рфии. Лично я его свободно покупаю в аптеке, правда в Раше он местного производства и имеет массу побочек.
Тамифлю, нос аквалором, лазолван, в конце пришлось флемоксин(( да, вроде полностью
А мне мой доктур запретил  Такое кушать-grumpy story! Кивнул главою,загрустил, Но жру,разбавив все"крестором"
финлепсин жру конскими дозами, пароксетин - самый мощный антидепрессант из СИОЗС что мне блять пить, чтобы существовать нормально?
Ебанная депрессия долбит с середины апреля, прозак и Адаптол еле достал, все по рецептам, будто Трамадол
Ну или Новаринг для гуглопоиска
Если это он, то не в США. До США талидомид не дошёл. Той врачихе, что не пропустила на рынок, даже награду дали. Пиздец минутка занудства в нашем эфире.
На моем доза ксанакса правильная стоит как раз
Я сразу врачам сказала что что угодно только не оланзапин
А меня опять трясет от флуоксетина
радует, что сероквель подешевел. теперь на лекарства будет уходить на 25% меньше
ну что там, уже четверг, завтра перекатываюсь на целую таблетку пароксетина. ещё бы поскорее сон наладился - цены бы ему не было. а пока я просыпаюсь в 4 утра и брожу по дому как сутулая псина.
поворт с ксанаксом это интересно :)))
адская смесь! Но от диареи помогает имодиум
моя жизнь - придумывать самосмейки и сидеть смеяться пока не понадобится симбикорт
Всего лишь одна таблетка Велаксина и из апатичного социофоба я превращаюсь в социально активного оптимиста который смог
Это я, нихуя не могу уснуть от кветиапина
Пробовал флуоксетин, вроде лучше, но доктор прописал другие – эти не оч
Выбрав флу вместо прозака, подчеркиваю никчемность этих особей.
Что является причиной ЖДА.  Паразитарные инфекции, избыточный бактериальный рост, кандидоз,  Гастрит и прием антацидных препаратов,  прием ингибиторов протонной помпы, заболевания тонкого кишечника такие как колит, болезнь крона, эстроген доминантность, прием метформина,
После жима как после паленого ксанакса также умираешь
Купить лекарство Адепресс в аптеке -
Чот решила посидеть на антидепрессантах, алкоголь уже не помогает. Даешь Прозак в массы!
Представляю клятву в дружбе моей и Кирка. Клянусь быть с тобой и с ксанаксом, и без ксанакса, и только ксанакс разлучит нас.
баклофен ­— аналог GABA, если им злоупотреблять, эффекты похожи на алкоголь, впрочем, без той части, где происходит отравление продуктами метаболизма. несмотря на это, тошнить будет долго и мучительно
Один кветиапин - разорение. 1500р за упаковку, которую хватит только на неделю.
@krkdes Не, ну, много у кого и венлафаксин тревожность купирует отлично, а скок ты его пила в итоге? И в чем ещё лечение не в ту сторону?..
Роспотребнадзор подтвердил информацию об изъятии из аптек «Сеалекса» и «Али капса» #бизнес
Победи другая команда, например, ВП или Нави, те же самые люди рассказывали бы, что адерал чисто доп и ничего не решает.
за неимением шарфов дышу через пуховой платок, плюс вентолин до и после. кое-как пять минут продержался тт
Я схожу с умаааааа  и вообще, за такие вещи без флуоксетина мне не стоит браться, наверное. Пометка себе на будущее
На самом деле три третий просто хочет выпить все упаковки метформина и сдохнуть. Но он самый эмоциональный так что я его не слушаю. Они все блять эмоциональные так что я их не слушаю и впервые тону в слезах.
обошла мильён аптек, но ни в одной из них не было пароксетина убейте блятб
один вопрос, почему мама мне всегда присылает стикер собачки, которая в зубах держит таблетку ксанакса, на что она намекает
Ох, я до этого пила только флуоксетин два года назад, мне было очень ок! Потом перестал помогать. А вот сейчас посоветовали как самый мягкий чтобы отследить все состояния
сука я не думала, что от 10 таблеток валерьянки и 2 флуоксетина меня будет так штырить
Вместо "зай", "кис", ласково называем друг друга со своим мужиком названиями антидепрессантов - Флу (от Флуоксетин) и Пакс (от Паксил)
тразодон аналогичен и побочек меньше у него. Но в аптеках моего города его вообще нет, мне кажется
- Меня назвали в честь звезды  - А меня - в честь мороженого. Отец его очень любил.  - А давай назовём сына Флуоксетином?
@din_alt1 Драсьте. Не забудьте лоперамидом запастись после такого ужина. Ну или шнапса 200 хряпнуть. Ничем не поможет, но это приятно
@rgznsk не удивлюсь если ты когда то нажрешся ксанакса и выпилишся. хотя о каких колесах может быть речь. скорее всего каким то дешевым бухлом)))))))) 000
Хочу пойти к психиатру возможно он выпишет антидепрессанты и возможно это будет флуоксетин от которого перестанешь хотеть есть
Отменили миртазапин, снизили дозу прозака и вернулись проблемы со сном. То есть удивительно. Макимальные дозы стимулятора (прозака; 60 мг) особо не влияют на сон, а вот небольшие (20 мг) делают сон рваным, то есть стимулирующий эффект во всей красе.
@turbofucka Проссак не знаем, знаем Прозак. 😮
Амитриптилин утром и вечером и оланзапин на ночь))
на прошлой неделе я была на учебе один раз. мне больно выходить из дома, больно двигаться, я не узнаю себя в зеркале,я не могу плакать. при этом я на прозаке
Когда тебе усиленно пытаются изгадить настроение, но ты на ксанаксе.
Пожаловалась врачу, что не могу слезть с антидепрессантов, и испытываю сильный синдром отмены.  "При ВСД с паническими атаками паксил может быть назначен пожизненно, как инсулин диабетикам"  Ммм, класс, пожизненно зависеть от АДов. То, о чем я мечтала.
я всегда говорил, что у нас вместо психолога и прозака-беседа и бухло. Иначе срыв обеспечен
@Zeronim0 @sd0107 Честно? Хуй знает.  Сальбутамол я купила когда забыла Саламол, на всякий пожарный.  Мне только год назад поставили астму и я пока не успела вникнуть во все тонкости.)))
Не буду спорить, бо не врач. Просто делюсь личным опытом: раздуло как-то губу, я въебал таблетку цифрана и на утро практически все прошло. Еще пару дней его пил, для закрепления
Про "Тамифлю" точно знаю - мега средство при только-что начавшемся заболевании. А вот по-поводу "для профилактики -

Интересно Лия еще употребляет прозак?
"Утром плакать перестала, задышала, ожила" - это Таня пошла купила свежую дозу сальбутамола
4. например, из-за велаксина я не спала два дня. вот просто не спала, я не могла ни успокоиться, ни сосредоточиться, ни что-то ещё. помимо этого у меня ужасно болел живот и меня постоянно тошнило. чтобы пить таблетки, я давала себе пощечины.
От нервного напряжения охота выбежать в окно с дикими воплями. Кажется, прерывание курса флуоксетина было так себе идейкой.
Прямо как у меня на адепрессе
Я очень бля надеюсь, что в аптеке есть озоновский флуоксетин Потому что !как оказалось! на другого производителя у меня аллергия  Такой отстой

Амоксиклав 1000 - 2 раза в день. Если на пенициллин аллергия или хочешь недорого, можно Цифран 500 мг 2 раза. Насчёт полоскания с содой и солью кто-то советовал - правильный совет
Или же прозак? Думаю, взять именно его, если продадут
К обжорству, а гормоны в норме? А то мож не там копаешь и одной поведенческой терапией пищевое не исправить? Еще вариант, норм Сибутрамин вместе с поведенческой. Сам пробовал бупропион, когда курить бросал, основательно похудел

@zefir1007 привет анорексия!!!!!!😃😃😃😃 жри флуоксетин. может поможет
не могу оставаться на ночь у мч целую неделю, потому что, видите ли, у него кот сидит на ПРОЗАКЕ, кот очень нервничает, когда хозяин спит с кем-то в одной постели.
@alisa_problems Я понимаю, что глупо об этом думать, но у меня сильные проблемы с восприятием себя   Я осведомлена о других побочках Но в другой раз мне вообще выписывали сероквель, что намного хуже и нейролептик У всех таких колес неприятные побочки
таваник кстати для дельфинов антибиотик
и это тоже, в случае с кветиапином\сероквелем цена может прыгать от 1к до 14к, обожаю атипичные нейролептики
Симбалта лечит меня от острой нужды в отношениях. Спасибо ей за это. Нет ничего хуже чем хотеть отношений, при невозможности их начать.
@upgrade16121 Мне кажется, вы немножко злоупотребляете целебным прегабалином)))
@AlexaBalasoiu Или ципролетом - растереть таблетку и намазать этим провод. Он очень горький и с первого касания больно.
Заказал на последние деньги ламиктал  Хоть бы недели на две хватило
@s4vch3nk0 @Diana_niga_ Блин, я так написал что ли 😆Лоперамид
— Я отлично справляюсь со смертью Дерека. — .. — У меня в кармане полный пакетик оксикодона. — .. — Я отлично справляюсь со смертью Дерека.
@plan_sa   спасибо😀  думаю, без сметаны и имодиума обойдёмся😀 мы привыкли без допинга 😜
@Loly_girl Ещё можно было написать, что лоперамид - это производное опиатов.
Всем привет от девки которая дознулась 360 мг кодеина + 600 мг флуоксетина + 3(???) бокала вина  4/10 мне конечно было относительно неплохо но я бы не советовала
С прозаком сон рвется и просыпаешься часто по мелочам. Чаще всего - от голода. Так на кухне прочно прописались яблоки.
ссссука как же это знакомо. И именно спирива и беродуал. Пиздец(
еще когда-то давно я жрал кветиапин от галлюнов перед сном но я уже не помню какие там побочки были
Но для лыжников, биатлонистов, Сальбутамол, хоть и не новый препарат, самое то. Снимает бронхоспазм, легче дышать. Норвежцы этим пользуются, что лн разрешен ВАДА в терапевтических целях.
Что блять не так я не понимаю я выпила три таблетки велаксина меня пиздет тошными и трусит
- напиши что - нибудь успокаивающее  - Пароксетин
они там ебнулись под ксанаксом
еще инфа для магистров в области самолечения: дозировку АДов не только повышают, но и снижают, мне так повышали и понижали прозак и было ок
"Лекарство от голода. Первой препарат «Саксенда» попробовал редактор Vogue и заявляет: проще способа похудеть не было!" Привет детям Африки.
Я выходил из дома, выпивал по 15 шотов, покупал кокаина на $100, не ложился спать до 6 утра. Потом брал 3 ксанакса и пару викодинов, чтобы попытаться уснуть. Просыпался около 5 вечера. В конечном счёте мне стало страшно.
мне пришлось обойти сразу дву аптеки, но ни в одной нет флуоксетина, а фенибут мне еще одну пачку докупать.
Как я устала от таблеток против аллергии, от таблеток против аллергии от таблеток, от капель и метформина. Организм — какая-то фармопомойка.
-Коть, ты когда-нибудь упарывался таблетками?  -Лоперамидом только
1. Удостоверение личности, транспортная карта 2. Экоавоськи, 2 шт 3. Капли в нос и глаза, таблетница с обезболом, корвитолом и мезимом 4. Пауэрбанк, зарядка, запасной кнопочный телефон 5. Блокнот-скетчбук, пенал с канцеляркой https://t.co/oi9TU2sLju
Сука как же я хочу нахуяриться флуоксетином. Потому что люди говно и злые. Блядь.
Один из основателей группы «Korn» оказался вовлечённым в мир денег и наркотиков. На пике своей карьеры, он пристрастился к алкоголю, снотворным и ксанаксу. Когда он стал христианином в 2005 году, он решил очистить себя от этих зависимостей.
Завтра сдаю кровь на Вальпроат. Страшно. Суставы ноют. Если доза прижилась, можно будет принимать от боли Габапентин.
прочитала "флуоксетином" и не сразу поняла, о чем ты ;D
@MAHAZAEL Ну крч отпустили ее вчера домой Может и так вылечится, не такой уж и страшный у неё случай. Тип совсем маленькие тромбы, рассосутся  Выписали ксарелто, лиотон, эластичный бинт и гольфы какие-то, ну и обезболивающее по необходимости
Я тут слез спустя год с Велаксина и меня даже немного прет — я оказывается умею грустить и злиться
идон - велафакс  крайне подозрительный на вид вроде какой-то никакой, а потом РАЗ И ВЫ ОБЪЕБАНЫЙ ЛЕЖИТЕ ЛИЦОМ В ПОЛ творит странную поебень
Оказалось что получить рецепт это пол беды. Если атаракс есть в любой круглосуточной аптеке, то пароксетин я не смогла найти нигде.
Хотя, конечно, ингалятор фликсотида на 60 доз стоит около 900 рублей. Мы ингалируем 1 раз в сутки - вечером. Т.е. хватает на 2 месяца.
Нельзя много ксанакса хавать, оч вредно
Объясняем с тётей фармакодинамику флуоксетина и периферического неврита лицевого нерва маме  Мама тоже стоматолог как бы 🤡 а тётя моя лор и провизор)))
могу: флуоксетин, асентра, золофт, амитриптилин. транк возможно назначать вместе с адом.
Дзверя се в пмбок-а и си мечтая за адерал
Люблю работать по субботам, солнышко светит, клиенты добрее  . . . Мысли под флуоксетином, ох 😃
У меня больше горловые.Утром пью беталок,энап,Индапамит.На ночь Кордарон,ново пасит.
Паксил не убирает тревогу :(((((( хорошо что хотя бы слезы убирает
Диасмарт - Образовательный клуб - Метформин опасный помощник
Воооот почему я на флуоксетине, поняяяятно
скорее всего сделают так, что Пульмикорт будет говорить голосом хауса
@asilikedem Первое: я - девушка. Второе: на прозаке норм жить. Просто уныло немножко (ебанутости тоже не добавляет, к слову). По идее, средство-то от депрессии, но, по факту и опыту, от него ещё более уныло.)
Паксил - потому и не нападаю.
Немного Кветиапин, немного Абилифай. х)
Симбиакс? Там флуоксетин и оланзапин вместе, как раз для биполярников
одногруппник сделал презенту про флуоксетин с мемами из типичной анорексички
может ксанакса ебнуть чтоб красиво вообще было
фликсоназе (более дешевый вариант назарел) рекомендую, моя мама аллергик со стажем, я на подхвате, очень довольны. раз в сутки - и ты дышишь.
Зачем мне левомицетин, если у меня лоперамид ？
@TheSuperDay @Zchtec ой на чем я только не торчал на кветиапине год на ксанаксе полгода на феназепаме год и со всего резко слез и все было нормалек, у меня мутация печени редкая, и я не могу заработать зависимость
Сегодня к шампанскому будет оксикодон или гидроморфон?
вчера выкладывал фото как он юзает ксанакс, а сегодня умер от передозировки тем же ксанаксом и опиоидным анальгетиком фентанилом
Когда сначала сероквель заменяют кветиапином, а потом кветиапин кветиаксом
Сутки в реанимации, дней десять в палате, потом ещё год Ксарелто пил, для разжижения крови. Курить меньше стал, а так не особо.
Золото в лыжах выиграла астматик. Все нормально? Так почему она не в паралимпийской команде? Ах, да, сальбутамол не запрещенный препарат можно " жрать" сколько влезет.
@hardestdumb Я за любые таблетосы, в любом количестве.  Желательно конечно ксанакс, но аскорбинки тоже хорошо.  Блокнотик и так ношу, почти всегда.
@flit_liza ТРиттико с Глицыном лупи мысль о суисайде улетучится,как роса с первым восходом солнца   Мне в агентом по сбыту нужна быть))0)000
Среди лекарств 1800 доз симбикорта, по 1200 — альвеско, сальбутамола и атровента, а также 360 доз вентолина. Ряд препаратов против астмы имеет эффект, схожий с анаболиками, увеличивающими физическую силу. Например, сальбутамол с 2017 года находится под частичным запретом #WADA.
Мне нужен Имодиум от людей, которые меня расстраивают
Ковалева: что такое безответная любовь?  Мы с Лерой ржать.  Я: безответная любовь - это обожраться флуоксетина и подавиться им.
Если правильно поняла, то согласна, озельтамивир и занамивир можно пить, сироп от кашля до 4х лет нельзя.
Кажется, комбо венлафаксин + флюанксол работает: у меня слезка проступила, пока я фильм смотрел
@fsqgera @xDe11x Симптоматическое лечение, покой, это все что нужно человеку не входящему в зону риска до 5 после 65.  Есть, Озельтамивир и ещё пара ребят из доказательной медицины, но они лечат только грипп (вы сами себе его не диагностируете) и лечат с оговорками.
ну у меня друг как-то на флуоксетине вроде сидел.Как-то смешал с алкоголем,нехилые глюки ловил.Потому я не пью антидепрессанты
мое второе "идите к черту, где мой прозак?"
@shaftrsn Они по рецепту В данный момент получаю в ПНД бесплатно - кветиапин (нейролептик), триттико (антидепр) Обе на ночь, и полетели
на спикинге мне рекомендуют бросить универ, уехать в другую страну с прозаком, ксанаксом и алкоголем
Аскорил с сальбутамолом, сальбутамол раскрывает легкие и заставляет сердце хуячить пульсом, если уже есть тахикардия или др проблемы с сердцем - будет такая реакция.
@reckderer нет, правда, не переживай, а то я сам начну загоняться,что накрутил тебя :/ не волнуйся, котёнок, мне ма уже дала эгилок, он специально для таких случаев. я лежу, вроде немного успокаивается
ладно, потеплеет, сниму эти ебаные сапоги и набегаю в пешкарике, если не разорюсь на вентолине.
ну извините, я последний твой твит про прозак помню
Мне в своё время при гриппе с высокой температурой помогли таблетки Тамифлю. Здоровья Вам!
Кофеин состоит из углерода, водорода, азота и кислорода — так же, как и кокаин, талидомид, нейлон, тротил и героин.  мы наркоманы господа

(гребаный сероквель!! глушит так, что очень тяжело не спать весь день; буду строить из себя позитивную няху, дабы уменьшить количество колес)
@dindondomdom Я не жить не хочу, я быть не хочу в таких условиях, что есть и суицид отменил, как решение. Сейчас под паксилом, страх упал, говорю бате все как есть и матери тоже, все стало налаживаться, но хуле я терпел то из-за когнитивных искажений все это дерьмо, не мог найти защиту себя &gt;&gt;
Стойте. А если выпить две пластинки паксила?
Ну, я говорю про задачи посложнее. Мне надо почитать исследования про метформин и сходу разобраться, от чего он помогает.
блюю санто-стефано на станции мамонтовская вспоминаю как «проебал» паспорт объебанный ксанаксом и мефедроном – слыш чувак твой паспорт? – ну да))) – нужен тебе? – ТА НЕЕЕЕ ЗАБИРАЙТЕ НАХУЙ НЕ НУЖЕН =))))
попробуйте наш Сеалекс, там 12 капсул - надолго хватит
Назарел, парни. Строго по инструкции и свои спрятать подальше. Ну и терпением запастись. Первый день адовый, сегодня дышу сама уже, периодически закладывает, но реально лучше в мильен раз
да пиздец, депакин и флуоксетин похуже будет))))) меня хоть фенизепамом не пичкают))))))))
Ну чо, дружочки-пирожочки, закину 4 ксанакса и феназепама для прикола
@silverbleis седалит, карбамазепин, флуоксетин, тизерцин (на ночь) с завтрашнего дня меняем схему
@флуоксетин ты должен был помочь мне а не делать хуже
Сравните этого клоуна и Пашу Техника под ксанаксом в одной из его программ. А если нет разницы, зачем платить больше?)
Ламиктал (Ламотриджин) 25 мг с постепенным повышением дозировки?
Читаю Скандал с сектой Нексиума. Про рабынь,доминанток,клеймо на лобке и думаю: это последствия популяризации бдсм сообщества или все-таки признак глубокого личного одиночества?ну и да,если видите тренинг личностного роста,любой-обходите стороной.это всегда сектолодобная херня
один из самых жутких моментов в моем анамнезе: я повысила дозу антидепрессанта и выпала в гипоманию, практически перестала себя контролировать, пока не начала принимать ламотриджин
@zvezdanews @zexep Серена, брат! Не будет тебе щасття! Лаващ  кущить - это тебе не ОКСИКОДОН ЖРАТЬ!😂😂😂
а в антидепрессантах, но все равно обидно. зато походу эти таблетки, феварин, трилептал и сероквель ак-то так вместе работают, что отходов нет вообще. что вчера, что сегодня не будет. хоть какой-то плюс в них.
@RedPand1116111 @IOzerin @mikeaktuell @HomoLudens19 @Nonpalpabilis Арбидол - всем известная пустышка. Тамифлю - да, но препарат тяжёлый, при своевременном употреблении замедляет развитие вируса и можно выздороветь на пару дней раньше.
мутирую в Казуки в течение жизни. в конце я нахуярюсь флуоксетина, запью водкой и сдохну. жаль, что мне уже не 19 лет.  ну типа чтоб вообще.
знаю принцесскин рецепт: запивала таблеточки вишнёвым! алкоголь+прозак=и ты Диана!
Если есть температура и вздутие живота, то это отравление и надо кушац уголь и Ципрофлоксацин, если нет противопоказаний. Я ничего не советую. Действуй на свой страх и риск.
Лол, флу - это флуоксетин? Если да, то я сочувствую помноженное на два
ну ты че тамифлю не пьёшь а
Спустя полвека найдена причина детских уродств, которые вызывало снотворное талидомид
пиздец заебашила ксанакса на ночь и мне приснилось что я в хемлоке обнимаю скарсгарда за плечи и говорю ему что он бусечка
Сука, у меня даже рецепт есть, а флуоксетина нет в трёх аптеках  Я тебя, мразь, бронировала, чтоб тебя нигде не было что ли
Тамифлю без доп стимуляторов должен помогать, если конечно грипп
@FairyofMatsuri пару недель назад ТТГ был 4,41, Т4 -1,47. С тех пор стала пить эутирокс 50 по 2 таблетки в день, а не по одной. хз.
без кветиапина мой вес возвращается к норме и я просто аа ебать как счастлив
Сальбутамол фигня! Симбикорт вот вещь для норвежских спортсменов
Лёг спать, пожелал всем спокойной ночи и всё такое. Но тут моему ёбнутому (как и я) мозгу захотелось похондрить и послушать депрессняк.  Лежу и загоняюсь.))0) Где мои глицинчик и флуоксетин?)
Вот буду богатой, вместо флуоксетина буду пить прозак, а вместо кофе - фенотропил. Но остальное остается прежним - жрать и спать.
Перкосет в моем смузи, Стреляю любовью из узи
Объебался флуоксетином, мозг плывёт. Но опять не смогу выпить достаточно, чтобы умереть.  Не, я не позёр, я просто слабак
На днях приятель познакомил с типом, которого главврач психушки держит на ксанаксе. Попросила показать ксанакс, мол в жизни не видала.
Как всегда тенденциозная заказная статья. По программе "Доступные лекарства" сегодня в Запорожье получил бесплатно по рецепту, выписанном семейным врачом, Пульмикорт суспензию. Кстати в аптеках города стоит 876 грн.
@esumain @VikChek Вопрос только насколько "родной" препарат похож на тот, который делает наша промышленность. Вот тот же Беталок  ЗОК  и Метопролол.
Я хз как у вас там, а у нас на районе все аптечные препараты способные вызвать торч, называют барбитурой, соответственно, тех кто это жрет, барбитурарщики. Сюда пойдёт и трам и лира, баклосан, триган, фенозепам, фенибут, да даже тот же галимый ремантадин
Мне кажется я уже настолько пережрала флуоксетина, что даже не принимая его, на весь происходящий пиздец моя реакция "ок,похуй"
Ципринол. Ничего страшного. Это антибактериальное.
Тут в твиттере пишут всякие ужасы про паксил.
Иногда хочется простого человеческого прозак
я всегда сплю на матрасе флуоксетина мне вас, если ругаться, жаль
Лоперамид в помощ, гарантирует спазм очеча
@nata30911 Да, периодически надо. Теоретически, это делается с врачом, мало ли какие особенности у вашего организма. Практически, в стране действует девиз- помоги себе сам. Я пью Эгилок,  25 дозировка.  А ещё неплохо помогает пить зелёный чай.
@MrQwalveg подзавязывай с баклосаном, кстати Гиблое дело Лучше сразу метадон 👍
@de_generat1488 я всех люблю! и ксанакс!
От волнения проносило, да? Есть лоперамид ;-)
но вообще я тебя люблю соре мне наверно просто пора накатить ламотриджину лол
Но вообще я прошлую неделю всю его пил и как-то не выздоровел до конца. Из противовирусных больше понравились Тамифлю и Циклоферон (внутримышечно), но тоже не всегда гарантировано помогают
Если не пройдёт эта болезнь, то набью татуху прозака 2.0 OG пока проверяется временем Но походу набью и то, и другое
Названия таблеток, если с чувством выговаривать, звучат как заклятия из Гарри Поттера. Этерофурил! Лопедиум!  Эргоферон!
У дилера ксанакс в четыре раза дороже :(
@Ziplock_dog @pizdecnaxyiblyt на высокобелковую неприятненько так с разбегу прыгать мелатонин индивидуально, мне с четырехлетним стажем кветиапина - слону дробина  а вот режим, умеренная физуха и цифровое голодание - рулят
поэтому теперь я просто закидываюсь пачками феназепама и алпразолама вперемешку, чтобы погасить отходосы от лечения. попахивает каким-то наркоманским притоном, а выгляжу я соответствующе

Короче, сменили препарат на циталопрам и приправили до кучи транком - ксанаксом. Ксанакс - прекрасен.Он просто делает из тебя пофигиста, которому хоть целыми днями Бузову ставь, хоть на голове революцию делай,ему будет совершенно насрать.Жаль, что на него быстро присаживаешься.

Снижение дозировки венлафаксина прям очень непростая штука. Я несколько месяцев привыкала к дозе в полторы таблетки после двух, потому что нельзя сидеть на нём вечно, он как бы для лечения. Теперь дозу снизили до одной таблетки, и это жестяк. Хочется только есть и спать.

Если человек согласен лечиться таблетками, мы выписываем антидепрессанты (я люблю селективные ингибиторы обратного захвата серотонина - сертралин, пароксетин). Иногда для прикрытия от панических атак имеет смысл использовать транквилизаторы - альпрозалам, клоназепам, феназепам
Что сделать, чтобы испытывать подобное? Прозак?
@SAnorexy эх.  Посмотрела цены на препараты для похудения и офигела.  А у флуоксетина цена более чем нормальная. Заинтересовалась.

Попробуй сероквель, хорошая штука. Спокойный детский сон, яркие сны и утром как огурец. У нас продают без рецепта, но он нужен, препарат серьёзный. Одну или половинку ща час до сна
а лоперамид не эффективнее разве?
Превозмогать нужно настолько эффективно, чтоб свихнуться, чтоб дали рецепт на баклофен, чтоб не боялся в соцсетях с тянами знакомится.
Я наконец-то купил паксил, и голова перестала кружиться, аве мне хддд Из потерь только проебанный телефон, блять хдддддд
Пиздец я нихуя не ела ни ху я Сплошные голодовки или 200-300 калорий в день  Я считала себя жирной  Я спрашивала у одноклассников сколько мне ещё надо сбросить  Я блять жрала пачками ебучий флуоксетин
во мне столько кофе и прозака, сколько я думала в человека без летального исхода поместиться не может в принципе
просто на всякий случай: единственные препараты, действительно эффективные при гриппе - осельтамивир (тамифлю, номидез) и занамивир (реленза) все остальные арбидолы, кагоцелы и прочие фуфломицины не работают
Здравствуйте! Мой муж инвалид 3 группы по заболеванию. Назначили новый препарат, Ксарелто, по льготе. Обратились в поликлинику, в аптеку, но там ответили, что люди не получали это лекарство с января месяца. Самим особо не разгуляешься, стоит почти 3 ..
После ксанакса. А ето ты до него.
Ципрофлоксацин поможет или скорую вызывать ?
Я вижу бокал полусухого, случайно смешанный с маминым маленьким помощником (ксанакс?). То ли ещё будет. В той же Германии каждая пятая женщина её возраста жёстко сидит на прозаке.
Как совпало с отменой сертралина =). "Чето спать стало хуже" "Ну давай или отменим сертралин, или еще больше кветиапина" "Давайте все же я буду жрать скорее меньше, чем больше"
ночью чуть не вызвала скорую птушо думала что меня инфаркт хватил. потом погуглила и поняла что это тот самый эффект отмены венлафаксина, о котором так долго говорили большевики, а я его тупо два дня забывала пить
В соседнюю аптеку поступил мой заказ с прозаком, а какие у вас новости этим прекрасным утром?
ламотриджин для стабилизации качель используют, чтобы фаза мании не особо наступала, ну и антидепрессанты
Тамифлю-противовирусное средство 1200руб,не пожалейте,действительно помогает,выздоравливайте!!!
Список антидепрессантов, поднимающих настроение, что бы бить людей с улыбкой на лице: Лудиомил Адепресс Мапротилин Потен Эндорфаин Файн-100
@ZavtraLeto С марта регулярно посещаю тётю-врача, пропит золофт, феварин, сейчас венлафаксин, всегда в компании с ламотриджином, у меня всё в порядке 😀
Алена решила суециднуться но: -вены вскрыть не получилось  -живет на 3 этаже -дома кроме лоперамида ничего нет (Лоперамид - таблы от срачки)
Как фанат творчества Паши Техника я должна носить маску обезьяны, ходить по улице без штанов и жрать ксанакс, но делать это я конечно же не буду
бля начинает физически пидорить от смены медикаментов и резкой отмены паксила и вообще я хотела на втором аккаунте настрочить сто твитов о том как я сейчас счастлива но мне так физически хуево что я с завтрашнего дня скорее всего не буду просыпаться и все забуду к хуям
хотя смари, лечение 2500. на таблетке ксанакса и таблетке рогипнола эту сумму можно даже перегнать
Это меня с сочетания стрезама и ксанакса так унесло или что
для этого пати не хватало ксанакса, ахахахаха
«Даже безобидный перекус может привести к поносу» Имодиум
Наладил поставку флуоксетина из Словакии ко мне. Так кто, ты говоришь, Sintik, тебе похоже нравится?
При совместном применении флуоксетина и алкоголя проявляются признаки повышенного содержания серотонина в крови и ещё ДОХУЯ всего разного и неприятного, лол
наблюдение: кветиапин вырубает через ~4-5 часов после приёма, если пить на ночь и незадолго до сна хорошенько поесть  ~15 минут если не есть на ночь
Какая нахер эманера, это коммерческое название. Правильное название - эзомепразол
Не терафлю, а тамифлю — это противовирусное) Нюхача давно хочу глянуть, но все никак не решусь)
Краткое пособие о ксанаксе от Паши Техника
увидела в тви профиль где на юпе холзи а в био строчка из ксанакса паши техника похоже я нашла самое точное описание меня
мне надо дожить до вечера понедельника. у меня тревога, тошнота, полное отсутствие аппетита, и последняя четвертинка кетилепта на случай пиздеца.
Флуоксетин - самовнушение? Ну ок, скажу это в следующий раз психиатру.
вещество алпразолам. и название алпразолам. вот если бы на упаковке было написано ксанакс тогда да. а так не считается
@Padfoot__Sirius добро пожаловать в лодку пьющих лекарства, чтоб до завтра оклематься ТТ вообще тамифлю хорошо помогает, но он, сцука, дорогой
Пронесло, пей Имодиум, на край случай Активированный уголь)))
БЛЯЯЯЯТЬ  ПОМНИТЕ ОТП В ТВИОП ФЛУОКСЕТИН С ЮЛЕЙ ФЛОУРИОИ И ЕЩЕ КЕМ ТО Я НЕ ПОМНЮ БЛЯЯТЬ АХАХМЖСЗСЗАЗА
Да это не ксанакс у него на языке, а аналгин. Я тебе говорю
Чем я слушал стоматолога, когда она говорила в каком порядке что принимать. Вот и что принимать первым: цифран или диазолин, бля
пропустил (ну котик долбоеб) десять дней флуоксетина  то есть как это, надо есть три раза в день?..
ну конечно, эксперимент. решили проверить, как будем жить без объявления эпидемии, когда ее нет и без закупки "тамифлю". это ж какое издевательство, не обналичивать на госзакупках бюджет. нам такие эксперименты ни к чему, пусть в своей америке бюджет экономит.
Но компания оказалась порядочной, и создала фонд на 100 млн.марок, которые должны были идти детям пострадавшим от талидомида. По разным данным на начало 90-х было выплачено 500 млн.маррк.  Ведь всем этим детям в течении всей их жизни нужен дорогостоящий уход.
Ципролет. Спасибо, что ты есть.
жаль венлафаксин меня не убил но это мощь конечно
@8zamknutost8 Пантопразол или эманера  Амоксициллин Кларитромицин После антибиотиков Рио флора (вроде) Последнее я не поняла, но вроде Ганатол 😅
Продавщица на рынке услышала, что у меня в наушниках играет Спартак 0:7 и продала "из под полы" Прозак.
Баклосан - это зло. Особенно отходняки с него. По возможности старайтесь избегать упарывания баклосаном.
Уфимские пенсионеры, посоветуйте пожалуйста хорошего пульмонолога 🙏 у одного была, но чет нифига его лечение не помогло, один вентолин спасает
по тнт казах кричит  я в детстве упал в чан с ксанаксом
Только эсциталопрам,  габапентин, вальпроевую кислоту, арипипразол и ламотриджин https://t.co/k7hWoti8fU
Прадакса, Эликвис, Ксарелто - три разных препарата одного действия. Самый дешёвый 2800 на 28 дней. Найдите аналог.
знаете эти надписи на баночках с лекарствами звучащие как названия фильмов с подзаголовками? типа «ЦИПРОМЕД ципрофлоксацин 0.3%» вы спросите, что это такое я хз. наверное, киберпанк
Не знаю как теперь общаться с теми, кто не знает про молковолновку/палецвжопе10лет/имодиум/2006 :'(
Прошел день, про Хокинга в моей ленте ни слова. Зато когда пореборщил с ксанаксом 21-летний виггер у которого в башке не было ничего кроме нищасной люпфи и как типо хуево жить, ссал кипятком каждый третий. Мда, где я вообще.
жизка. пила сероквель, когда с депрессией лежала(нихуя не помогло, зато денег много проебала)
- как тебя зовут? - ксюша - а полное имя? - ксанакс алпразолам анксиолитик производное бензодиазепина C17H13ClN4
@upgrade16121 турецкий прегабалин сегодня юзаю, Галара называется, такого ещё не видел. 11×150 сожрал и нифига. Или слабый, или толерантность. Скорее всего толерантность.
Белладонны листьев экстракт + Кофеин + Парацетамол + Теофиллин + Фенобарбитал + Цитизин + Эфедрин = действительно "социально-значимый" состав. Это вместо Спиривы, Фликсотида и пр., интересно, или для общего поддержания духа?
Алеся, проси Сероквель вместо этого говна российского! Он очищенный и не дженерик! Приходов не будет!
@kak_otrezal Ох, да, уже пришлось расчехлить свой чемоданчик Тут верно советуют местные гормональные спреи на основе флутиказона, у нас это Фликсоназе, Авамис (если курсом - прям хорошо помогает) + капли (лекролин, кромогесал) + таблы  Ещё есть тема пройти АСИТ, не пробовала?
@55privet555 Ацекардол метопролол индапамид и прочее Они спасают реально
Утро началось с двух таблеток лоперамида, двух таблеток эспумизана, двух таблеток омепразола и двух таблеток ношпы
Чтобы новогоднее настроение поднять, Нужно Прозак с Литием въебать.
Самый большой вред, который причиняли мне наркотики –огромный шишак на лбу, когда я под ксанаксом прыгнула в кровать и пизданулась об спинку
Охуительно блять, метформин теперь по рецепту
@Andrei101niK @supermnenie @77DVD77 @denegnetnixya в нашевремя от гриппа  умирают в ЛЮБОЙ стране. если начинается пневмония  вирусная лечтить почти невозможно. Питание снеобходимым количеством живытных жиров в первую очередь масла и прививка  помогают и реленза ользатомовир или тамифлю ну на худой конец ремантадин помогают
Среди больничных запасов он обнаружил талидомид
Бой нужен ксанакс е бои нужен ксанакс
Я тоже когда они играли подумала про битву "Мельдоний против Сальбутамола"
сегодня со мной случилось новогоднее чудо — я нашла тразодон потерянный год назад
7. Не зассала и свалила из дома после очередной ссоры с ма Мало того, что поняла, насколько нужно ценить заботу родителей, так еще побывала в притоне, где обитатели объебывались ксанаксом После этого поняла, что я еще не безнадежна, ну и с ма мы больше не ссорились в принципе
Считаю, что наши ребята, выиграли эту эстафету! Норвеги, точно, бежали на сальбутамоле! Но и им доктор разрешил((((
пиздец, мне приснилось как я с дноклассником объебался ксанаксом
Как большой любитель порядка пишу перед поездкой дотошный список, где первым пунктом идет аптечка, а первым подпунктом - лоперамид.
1. Это вакцина она стоит 1800 у нас. 2. Второе Спирива это дыхалка от приступов. Задыхается мама. она 2800 стоит. около 5 тыщ за все.
Чем мне нравится розувастатин(крестор).  Он не только снижает холестерин, но при наличии стенозов стабилизирует атеросклеротическую бляшку.   Это важно.
Выгружаю всё таблетки с рюкзака, врач попросил посмотреть, что у меня есть. Тут на глаза ему попадается пачка прозака В: Что это? Я: Ну, вы и сами знаете В: *улыбается, достаёт с кармана точно такую же* Я вас понимаю
Что предлагаете взамен? Клопидогрель? Уже практически не назначают. Альтернатива - ривароксабан, и не всегда. Позвольте спросить, Вы практиковать изволите или все по теории?
глицин слабее феназепама и флуоксетина, но по рецепту не продаётся
Снова здорово! 👋🏼 здесь кажется все пропахло оксикодоном
я еще ксизал обожаю и аквамис с назарелом
я ещё никогда в жизни так не ждала момента, когда можно будет проспиртовывать себя   (по факту, после курса ципрофлоксацина ещё неделю надо воздержаться, но я что, так похожа на человека, который нуждается в реабилитации?)
а тараканов сальбутамолом надо попробовать потравить, дыа
Задолбало болеть. Всю неделю насморк, кашель, но без температуры. Колдрекс, стрепсилс, амброксол, сальбутамол, пиносол. Вторая пачка салфеток размера "эконом плюс". Погуляла под снежком, блин.
Как говорил один Михаил : А ВЫ ПОЙДЁЕЕЕЕЕТЕ НА ПАСОШООК??? ДААА??? Я БУДУ КРИЧАТЬ БАКЛОФЕН И НАЙДУ ВАС
Могу дышать только с сальбутамолом. Допрыгался.
@xsmmooxxxoo @prima_bezfiltra Нет. Мне прописали нейролептик Кветиапин (Сероквель) и антидепрессант Тразодон (Триттико). Значительно улучшилось засыпание, я перестал просыпаться ночью, уменьшилась тревожность. Из минусов: тяжело просыпаться не по времени. Но, когда всё-таки проснулся, то сонливости нет.
Примерно такой муд. Где там мой прозак
Надо бы всё-таки съездить получить новый рецепт я уже не знаю сколько дней назад пила ламотриджин и золофт и амитриптилин вот-вот кончится я плачу с поводом и без
У нас теперь на работе новая корпоративная шутейка "ты че, под ксанаксом?"
на край антибиотки, если дикий грипп то тамифлю хорош. И да, врач!
Нексиума у меня нет. Только Ибупрофен.
блин хата открыта а я уехала если обнесут то батя подумает что это я сделала ради паленого ксанакса
И как вы планируете с ним справляться, с этим животным началом? Прозак? Вживление чипов? Что-то другое?
я мальчик и кушаю триттико, не все так однозначно
кажется я знаю, в чем причина того, что мне так хреново и мне так тревожно. одно слово. кветиапин. :&lt;
Брат. Купи спрей Назарел в следующем году. 2 года только им спасаюсь, 2 пшика утром и через неделю нет аллергии. Эти штучки пихал в нос. Хз.
@big_pisun @forscient И для полного счастья ещё полгода левофлоксацина для сухожилий 😏😁
ааааааа бэйби к твоим ногам я сыпала таблетки ксанакса, прости.
Не мое это когда висела на нем более 10 лет а сейчас нету, я тупо опидоревшая! Без прегабалина мне не жизнь, и опиум не радует
эт прям наименование производителя и отношение ко всему, пока ты на флуоксетине, в одном флаконе
из-за отсутствия паксила в Минске пришлось заменить его дешевым аналогом, чувствую себя достаточно разжеванно
Сеалекс плюс Борзыкин = СЕКС
Понял, что из-за Ксанакса нельзя пить.  Грустно.
@notashk не шмог найти пикчу, но смысл такой, что бисопроЛОЛ, метопроЛОЛ, карведиЛОЛ
чувак пишет что спустя неделю велаксин не работает ХММММ ПОЧЕМУ ЖЕ &gt;сука месяц хотя бы нужно принимать &gt;нельзя юзать во время курса венлы ЭТО ЖЕ БЛЯТЬ ЯСНО &gt;нельзя мешать любую хуйню с венлой два ада подряд ни к чему хорошему ни приведут &gt;ПИТЬ ТЕМ БОЛЕЕ СУКА НУ
эти речи так хорошо работают, что в аптеках тамифлю не купить) его жрут все и для профилактики в том числе (!)
Томск : Где в томске можно купить сальбутамол московский(семашко)?
@zaryazhaem От лица адекватной части CRAPNEWS рекомендую ксанакс и мезим
Умираю со смеху! Своя дочь астматик. Активный спорт, но ни в коем случае не соревнования и Олимпиады! Это прямая насмешка! Да, Вентолин не гормональный препарат, но он участвует в процессе дыхания АЖ на ЧЕТЫРЕ ЧАСА! Этого не знает МОК?! ЗНАЕТ! ЛОЖЬ, ПИ@ДЕШЬ И ПРОВОКАЦИЯ! https://t.co/AfRgeYxspC
Анон, пробовал пить зверобой в качестве антидепрессанта? И ещё элеуторококк и женьшень? Сейчас пью золофт с ламотриджин ом, но они заканчиваются, а купить стоит немало. Хватает только на зверобой. Будет ли эффект?
Просто Крюгер при падении сбил дыхание, и ему срочно понадобились пара впрысков сальбутамола, которого норвежцы официально привезли целый чемодан.
Такой вариант: 1 рексетин + 2 спитомин + 2 фенибут + 1 Фенотропил..
Мне сейчас ксанакса всего мира не хватит
Приятно радуют рекламные интеграции у Паши Техника, посвящённые финансовым инвестициям. Определенно - это именно тот человек, чьей рекомендации в этом вопросе я доверяю. Раньше он играл с самим собою, а теперь на валютных рынках.С ксанакса на опцион, из андера в Форбс. Охуительно
@MCRstomach Первое нет, мы с бабушкой давали ему уголь, имодиум, смекту и энтерофурил  И как, по-твоему, ребенку при отравлении помог бы гомеопатический фуфломицин (кагоцел)?  Вряд ли в домашних условиях выйдет поставить капельницу
Под прегабалином так классно смотреть на экраны софиты и всякую там подсветку. Просто АЩ.
однажды было совсем хуево нажралась флуоксетина и залила все это дело водочкой  хуйня не советую
Слушай, а это не может быть побочка от ламотриджина?
есть два стула : героин точеный и алпразолам дроченый. куда сам сядешь, куда главного героя работы посадешь?
понимаешь. я начина. сходить с ума от этого флуоксетина  моей психике жопа я не понимаю что со мной
В комнате муха под ксанаксом (((
Лираглутид эффективен только в краткосрочном периоде
Мне нельзя, я на тамифлю(
Мне по Сальбутамолу консультация не нужна,папа на нем(до этого был Астмапент)давно,астматик с больше чем 40ка летним стажем,мне важно было узнать не механизм действия Серетида,а как люди его принимают,по ск ингаляций и ск раз в день. Дякую)
Причём здесь Ющенко? Вот Лещенко о тамифлю закупавшемся при Тимошенко. Надеюсь Вы не будете утверждать что Лещенко порохобот?
Назовёшь ссаный алпрозолам ксанаксом (X ANA X),будешь петь про него или читать загадочно,и вот это уже не просто седация,а новый крутой наркотичек Ну да,иногда поспать бывает кайфово,но можете просто подождать свои 20+ лет
Димон, запасайся имодиумом, чтоб "реакция" не застала врасплох
Заебали вы со своим ксанаксом.
Хорошее настроение заменили Прозаком. Держу в курсе
Задетектить в составе сальбутамол @ Перепутать сальбутамол с солутаном @ Порадоваться безрецептурной продаже @ Осознать @ Приуныть
Психиатр выписал флуоксетин. В интернете очень много инфы про потерю либидо. Аноны, я смогу ебать тянов если буду есть это?
ШТА??? ну это сугубо ваше личное мнение. я лопаю прозак и горя не знаю
И с ингалятором сальбутамола в руках!
а что ты этиотропного назначаешь? Фуфломицин? Или из доказательного-шлефуешь римантадином и осельтамивиром?
Почему–то вспомнилось это упоительное — А ты чего такой спокойный, как будто тебе не больно? — Да я ксанакса нажрался, хочешь? (не спрашивай, откуда я знаю этот диалог)
Алин я больше года хуячу бензодиазепины тупа аптечная наркоманка нет психиатр сам выписывает просто по русски называется алпразолам
за весь день в мусорку попали: -банка пива -упаковка прозака -пакетик чая фсё
А что, вентолин запрещён, как мельдоний?
Такое ощущение, что линейку моих препаратов выписывали Золдики: Альпрозолам Ламотриджин
@Crousor - мой личный сорт флуоксетина
Пока на месяц прописали золофт и сероквель
поздно проверять щитовидку, когда и так на эутироксе. \о/
Я ТЕБЯ ЛЮБЛЮ БОЛЬШЕ ЧЕМ ПАША ТЕХНИК ЛЮБИТ КСАНАКС
@Noisele99573128 Нету, дорогая, нету.  Я неделю назад "слезала" с паксила. Вот там дааааа. Если интересно, могу рассказать
Дайте мне шмали, снюса, сигарет, алкашку, ксанакса, дайте мне всё. Я нахуярюсь, пойду спать.
опять на нексиум на недельку сверну, потом обратно к витамину д. Уколу тут делают крайне редко. В основном пожилым.
Рапортую: таблетки принял. Побочки противные. Ещё вместо тебантина продали аналог от fpizer (? Так пишется ?).
Это не противогаз, а детские средство для ингаляций. В России таких полно. Туда добавляется, например, Пульмикорт для облегчения дыхания, и ребенок им дышит.
На ужин валерьянка с флуоксетином. На завтрак валерьянка, флуоксетин закончился. Слезы не уходят Хочется орать
Психиатр прописала мне флуоксетин и ещё что то :)  Chtoj.
бля а без кветиапина некомфортно, думаю, он всю работу и делает, антидепрессант стоило менять только ради избавления от моторных побочек
Рад что мы разобрались в том, что астма случается, а сальбутамол не допинг и его принимают все. В остальном вам не помогу, я уже 25 лет живу с бронхиальной астмой, а не СДВГ.
Tylenol back pain, всякие ночные лекарства от кашля, что угодно с димедролом (diphenhydramine), главное, не злоупотреблять. Ну и плюсую про тразодон, хотя он и по рецепту только
моему деду ни разу не выдали,инсулин и метформин да,причём качественные и отечественные
Заоблачное сияние тьмы, менталитетом Введенный тариф: вновь парить, Я задыхаюсь от боли, твори, вентолин Паритет нашей дружбы стал пылью.
полтора часа назад я зашла в инст, чтобы посмотреть акаунт Glossier  очнулась на ривердэйле и шэйне на ксанаксе
Пароксетин. Самой не хватает, надо идти продлевать рецепт. Плохая, плохая взрослая жизнь
сука. ты.тбляцкая. 4 таблетки кветиапина и амиприлина нам зачем нахуй нужны? как думаешь, старая больная, женщина? не больная, а я бы сказала отбитая
Для бега за ксанаксом если только
Когда рейтинг разложения упадет, а пока - сеалекс: а что? а вдруг?
Дадим тебе) что прописали - пульмикорт?
Ай мин, у каждого своя степень тяжести, кому-то венлафаксин — тяжеляк, отрубающий всё, что можно, а кто-то жрёт по 150 мг, как я, и по-прежнему ненавидит эту жизнь))0
Ей не нужно много, ей нужно так мало, всего лишь пару миллиграммов, детка, это ксанакс
До свиданья нервный мир.распаковываю пачку прозака
Впервые за долгое время у иеня сальбутамол в кармане
Учу по фармакологии антидепрессанты и ловлю флешбеки, как ходила и искала флуоксетин без рецепта в аптеках своего города. Как же хорошо, что время #ТА для меня закончилось.

Не многие поймут про ксанакс,но те кто поймут орнут)
вчера я убила кошку, сегодня мы с .@varrrvararudol везём кастрировать кота ксанакса. такие выходные
"В организме актрисы Кэрри Фишер, нашли героин, кокаин, метадон, а также алкоголь, следы морфина, кодеина, оксикодона и МДМА (экстази)" 8-)
Сколько нужно ксанакса, чтоб очистить мир от клауд-реперов?
Надо было купить прозак и витамины
@Pullusvega Как вариант - выпить пробиотик на выбор (Аципол, Бифиформ, Линекс). Эффективность слабая, действует не очень быстро.  Если диарея сильно беспокоит, то можно выпить закрепитель - Иммодиум (лоперамид). Но не сильно им увлекаться, лучше вывести из себя лишнее, а не удерживать
Плохо подобрали. Я на велаксине была спокойная как удав и абсолютно не сонная.
Пресс-конференция Фрума:  - Вы все еще используете сальбутамол? - Это не ваше дело, это медицинская информация  #королевичелисеймеждутемпосветускачет
ааа я просто не могу я в восторге от того, как ахуенно мне подошла комбинация финлепсина с пароксетином ещё бы зп поскорее пришла, чтобы я на психотерапию поехала, потому что колёса - это, конечно, хорошо, но и разгребать все свои травмы надо
Надо повышаться до максимальной дозы прозака.   проснулась, поплакала. теперь надо покурить.
НО и тут настигли попытки проснуться. Сижу в кресле, обожравшись Прозаком и вискарем, а мне "Тони, у нас там разборки, надо ехать"
@andrii_sbl @elenagenina @BorisBorisenko5 @Bad_Bandera А вжэ  знайшли все украденное?Кроме тамифлю и контрактов на газ,которые в итоге оказались удачными и продуманными,которые,кстати спровоцировал прыщатый  и  умотал отдыхать в карпаты,ничего у  барыг  на Юлю нет.
Ибупрофен Кетанов Цифран Анальниг В студию, желательно пачками
Ну, мне сразу сказали, что это не лечится. Дозу эутирокса виставили по анализа. Так и живу уже который год
Выпью без спроса Вики ксанакс (надеюсь не будет злиться) и пойду спать, а то совсем не могу уснуть
Хм. Первый придется пропить в любом случае - там 6шт, вроде. Где-то на 3 станет полегче. Во втором как раз есть сальбутамол, он должен убирать спазм. Давно пьете второй?
как и прегабалин) все-таки продажу некоторых препаратов лучше ограничивать)
Метформин в сочетании с препаратом от давления подавляет рост раковых клеток
Пьем с котиком вкусное саперави от @fanagoriawinery.  Оно очень крутое, душистое, тягучее и свежее. С флуоксетином вроде норм, пока не умер!
метформин, например, только его курсить надо, флуоксетин тот же
Надеюсь не сдохнуть от сальбутамола
пишет заявы и эссе, в приступе депрессона подтягивается и пьет спрайт и паксил. прямо хоть в рамочку этот образ современного ПЕЧОРИНА. лол.
Против ксанакса в 2к18, хех
вывод - имитация оргазмов лечится сальбутамолом ?
Итак, проснулась, от тревоги всё дрожит, начинаем тестировать местный аналог ксанакса, день первый
Сижу на фильме про Лил Пипа под ксанаксом)))))0000
Музыка, комиксы, винище и бэй - лучшие антидепрессанты после Паксила
Обсыпьте меня горой ксанакса, я задолбалась страдать
@korobkov бомбануло, побежали за имодиумом
Оланзапин может с гормонами начать шалить, вес подскочит. И мб позже придётся присоединить бипериден чтобы убрать побочки типа беспокойных мышц. Но это редко и бывает только у самых "везучих". Но со всем этим лучше все равно с колёсами, чем без них
хочу отказаться от паксила потому что появились неадекватные мысли в голове и панические атаки которых никогда не было
@valerieisdead рэпует с автотюном ебёца с сеалексом
Сегодня решила устроить небольшой зажор Так сказать, дать метаболизму взбодриться Блинчик с нутеллой, 2 бутера с колбаской, банан, кружка кофе (надеюсь, доза метформина меня хоть как-то спасёт) Обедать, пожалуй, не буду, а после ужина бисрак в помощь #доброеутро
Против депры голосую за бупропион в терапевтических дозировках, либо как дополнение к основе. Безопасность прозака не всегда безопасна ИМХО.
Глюкофаж посоветуй вместо метформина, скажи что для глюков. :) (если кто не в курсе это одно и то же, просто разных фирм).
Мы ничего не делим, кроме сенаде, регидрона, пульмикорта и дексаметазона
ТАБЛЕТКИ ТАБЛЕТКИ ТАБЛЕТКИ Я СНОВА ЗАКИДЫВАЮСЬ ПАКСИЛОМ

Ей, как оказалось нужен был сальбутамол, а это от астмы.
вчера хотела написать,что теперь милейшего мальчика диарея замучает в каталажке),хорошо воздержалась,там астма,ничЁ-сальбутамол..
Самый быстрый поход к врачу: эндокринолог сказала, что я сделала правильно, что подняла себе дозу левотироксина. А говорят, самолечение - это плохо!
Ребята у меня скоро др Лучший подарок для меня это 3 пачки буденофалька капс. 3мг №50  👌🏻
Охуенно длинный список побочных эффектов у ципрофлоксацина.
сначала Сеалекс прибили наглухо теперь за гандоны взялись. А Нагиев с Лопыревой двигают Ловелас. Совпадение?
пришли на ужастики а у главной героини были проблемы с наркотиками и при упоминании ксанакса по залу проходил тихий смешок наркоманов
Разбиралась в аптечке. Нашла габапентин, флуоксетин, а главное, прорву, просто ПРОРВУ феназепама. Живем!
последний урок и я иду за флуоксетином  наконец то
@Weterra Метформин в тех же дозировках, но купленный в другом месте прекрасно действовал. И до периода приёма подделки и после.  Поскольку я им привозил 2  или 4 упаковки, то в курсе всей истории.
Группа "Труп срёт в гроб" отказалась выступать на фестивале "Захоронение" из-за отсутствия лоперамида в райдере
Посадили обратно на анафронил + сероквель
@Kurutta_Taiyou ты учти, что я быдло и на флуоксетине)))
Запиваем лоперамид пивом и никакова суецида
представила, испытала желание вколоть себе одновременно спирт, флуоксетин и героин
ципралекс и ламолеп (непростое украшенье)
@s_obake_n Ксанакс Тригана передоз большой  Или спиды вжахни там Ну или травушку курни За кроки научит тян курить🐊
Вот реально какой кайф нажраться ксанакса и чувствовать,как твой разум улетает
сука, вот читаю про лечение своей биполярки. прием венлафаксина год и более создает 35% вероятности перехода в гипоманию я пью уже год, и где она блять я ее очень жду
алсо сегодня первый день без прозака, посмотрим, как я справлюсь
Пацан-лар Назначили Аатракс ?(вроде 3 раза в день) и паксил вроде 1 раз в день утром. Врроде что то из этого блочит никотиновые рецепторы. Как я буду теперь курить, и будет ли хоть какой то эффект с сижек? или вооббще усилит
а хочу закинуться завтра с утречка флуоксетином и листать ленту в инстаграме где все будут лизаться и писать сопливые посты ух
Спасибо Паше Технику и ксанаксу за успешную сдачу сессии
безжалостные и беспощадные. Триер плотно сидит на Прозаке, ему и без Прикамки хорошо
Сибутрамин в наличии 20-30 мг отправлю по Украине и за пределы!
Симбикорт турбухаллер 4.5мкд, 60 доз у нас стоят 1500, хватает на месяц (утром и вечером), врачи говорят революционный не вызывающий привыкания препарат, пользуюсь уже лет 5, но при этом курю лет 10, поэтому на меня равняться особо не стоит
Почитайте состав ксанакса))))) его выписывают даже от бессонницы
@alina4evers @zakroj_sifon Ближе держись к туалету, "Имодиум" не подведёт. А если поймешь, что туалета здесь нету, Ну я, блядь, не знаю тогда.
Очень даже норм. Сероквель какая доза?
баклофен, кофеин, эфидрин, феназепам, фенотропил, фенибут, флуоксетин Набор моей жизни
@upgrade16121 Есть такое дело в аптеке, но ща полегче, оланзапин, тералиджен, хлорпротиксен шоб спать хорошо
Бля, если я ещё раз увижу где-нибудь слово ТОКСИЧНЫЙ, то, ей-богу, я выжру оставшиеся у меня сорок таблеток алпразолама разом, сука!1! КАК ЖЕ ВЫ РАНЬШЕ ВЫЖИВАЛИ-ТО БЕЗ ЭТОГО СЛОВА, БЕДНЕНЬКИЕ. ДОРВАЛИСЬ!
@nadischerbinka так будем лечить доктора! Прописываем Вам: Стопангин, йодинол, оливковое масло и ципролет =) Скорее вызоравливайте! =)
@fantaziya97 Вот это ответ👏👏👏 А имодиум, что за таблетки🤔
Онанизм, флуоксетин, депрессия. Да и, кстати, не хуй высыпаться
Венлафаксин запила ред буллом. Полет нормальный.
@pieceofdasha @bldthrstbtwhl Номидес тоже самое, что и тамифлю.
я на днях зуб обычный удалял, ципролет прописали.
Носовое кровотечение, головная боль, рассеянность, тошнота, злость, злость, злость. У меня вопрос - это ламотриджин, погода, или стресс, который каким был, таким и остался (но с которым я справляюсь с блеском не в последнюю очередь благодаря ламотриджину).
Хочу въебать флуоксетина и думать об учёбе, а не о тебе.
Ну, привет, Вентолин и Симбекорт
и до лета надо похудеть поэтому мкц и глюкофаж снова будут помогать😊🙏
КАКАЯ БОЛЬ КАКАЯ БОЛЬ ЛАМИКТАЛА ТАБЛЕТКИ ОБЪЕМОМ
Ух бля ебался 3 часа под лошадиной дозой ксанакса.
У колорада диарея, просил меня в аптеку за лоперамидом сбегать, но адрес уже не в силах написать, помирает от обезвоживания, помогите ему кто может.
Казань : Подскажите где можно купить сальбутамол московский семашко
Прозак с алкоголем норм. Только алкоголя нужно меньше
Я узнал, что у меня есть огромная семья. Полотенце. Маска. Ласты. Сеалекс. А что? А вдруг?
опиоиды  В других странах: Викодин, оксикодон, фентанил, кодеин, алпразолам, трамадол, опиум и т.п В России: триган-д
@drunk_cachallot Лоперамид,  ибупрофен, Фталазол,  плюс свои ежедневные таблэтки. Скальпель - ментам уныние, а режет добряче. Пластырь, есно
Лучший тренд 2018 года на данный момент - отказ от ксанакса и формирование негативного образа наркотиков среди молодежи Лил Пампом и другими фрешменами
мне в рф какф-то прописали прозак (о котором я кст до этого говорила что он не подходил) и не дали рецепт сообщив что "в аптеке нужно просто хорошо попросить" (чел стоил 4к за сеанс)
Пишут, сами не знают что! К анаболическим стероидам никакого отношения Сальбутамол не имеет, Вы правы. А по фото видно, дама плотно сидела на анаболических стероидах.
Короче идите нахуй По инструкции пульмикорт нужно 1 раз в день принимать после ингаляции через 5 минут Но мне блять ваще лучше не становится поэтому я буду его 3 раза в день сосать Надеюсь если будет передоз вы придете на мои похороны
Можно такой же мем с паксилом и атараксом тогда это будет мем моей жизни
@bonbon_gi Лоперамид, уголь, смекта Все, что найду
@xpam_molodoctu доктор: на что жалуетесь?  пациент: бля, обожаю пиздить пиколюхи с твиттеров свою инсту  доктор: ксанакс и самоубийство.   следующий.
Прогулял физ ру  Обожрался ксанаксом  На алгебре сижу и ем вагину одноклассницы  Эта проститутка даже не сказала мне спасибо  Это не красиво
как же заебали школьники, которые текут по лину, ксанаксу (по пендоской хуйне) вы родились в великой стране, в которой наверное самая дешевая водка и пиво. пользуйтесь 😉
Где я сказал что оксикодон звучит круто? Ты че ебанутая?
бесите сука малолетки лиж бы дичь спизднуть.Да ты сука от ксанакса бы буквы бы проебала . Ксанакса обожралась,ну не ебанашка ли
ДА ПОЧЕМУ Я НЕ ЕМ НО ТОЛСТЕЮ  КВЕТИАПИН Я ТЕБЯ НЕНАВИЖУ
@_koosh @awsome_kris ЛОПЕРАМИД при диарее. Помогите нуждающемуся!
Периодически за день случались такие эмоциональные качели, что Конни-Айленд не снилось Но в целом паксил хорош, держит крепко Без него был бы пиздец кромешный
Отъехал по работе. После двух капсул габапентина.  Чем выше стресс, тем дальше едешь)
87. Ребята, 50 мг ламотриджина это уже не так радостно. И на таблетках я разорюсь, если университет не будет оплачивать мне материальную помощь (уж раз в семестр могли бы и не жмотиться!)
не знаю, насчет ксанакса, но нейролептики - это пиздец определенно, я решила, что не буду их пить)
Fancy Bears обнародовали информацию о том, что пловец Майкл Фелпс принимал габапентин.
#Томск : Мне нужно купить флуоксетин без рецепта
@suyup_l Ох, Лерок, какой глицин, я на прозаке уже плотняком😥спасибо 💞
@_ianmeeh @vladanrains От золофта начала рандомно падать в обмороки, перевели на паксил С паксилом все то же, что написали выше, но только сон был, как будто отключали, ощущения отдыха не было.
Как я ещё понимаю, что Имодиум как раз на мозг изначально воздействует, где-то читала, чтобы он подал сигнал кишечнику перестать дёргаться?
@Tegra_Hoshi А я честно назначаю) Я просто часто хожу про ксарелто слушать. И назначаю, потому что всеми фибрами ненавижу варфарин)
Квентиакс и каликста остались, что они как маленькие, в самом деле )
Трамадол, спазмалекс, кодтепин, баклофен, туссин, кодетерп, коффикс, триган-д, смеси, соли
@Natalya57_57 Наталья, метформин более чем известен. Я его принимаю третий год. Нет там ничего опаснее «химии».   @IngaZaionz
мне прежней было бы страшно, но во мне накопилось столько велаксина, что мне весело и радостно ехать к хрен знает кому чтобы меня там пытали
@CashCanFixIt Попей рексетин 20 мг день. Первые 6 дней полтаблетки. Потом  3 недели по одной, потом  7 дней полтаблетки. Проконсультируйся с врачом!
меня заебало пить паксил и я хочу чтобы меня убили
смотря что пить. От флуоксетина похудела за месяц на 4 кг, хотя специально для этого ничего не делала) но не советую, конечно
канешна, на прошлые игры было завезено всего 3000 доз сальбутамола
@Lana_kv50  @AvdonNatalja @Tularegion71 Добрый день ! Администрация ГУЗ ТО "Киреевская ЦРБ" повторно доводит  до Вашего сведения, что Вы будете обеспечены препаратом "Симбикорт"  05.10.2018.
а вот обязательно в каждом фанфике по МакРайли писать, что Кирк сидит на ксанаксе?
Зависит от клинической картины. Дозы и реакции организма. Если врачу доверяешь то все нормально. Есть сомнения сходи на приём к другому. Поинтересуйся. Если СИОЗ это флуоксетин, то не парься принимай спокойно :)
Поцоны, на паксиле никто не сидит? У меня 12 таблеток осталось, могу обменять на что-нибудь или продать (но только если у вас на него рецепт есть, самолечение не уважаю)
не помню дышала ли сегодня симбикортом
Лорик, радуйся! Хоть что-то)) Плохо, что побочки такие( Сибутрамин-то лучше заходил
В отделе бурное обсуждение похудения и флуоксетина. Настя: Если Регина меня убьёт, то мне не придётся худеть. Алёна: А ты не хочешь в гробу красиво смотреться?
На верху, похоже, начали принимать Аддерал в перерывах между оргиями.
Тамифлю лишнее, это строго от гриппа, при нем на суды не ходят точно
Аптечка.Лоперамидом останавливаем срачку,пока не подействовало затыкаем проём ушными палочками. @temuh_nice
ой, у них и бупренорфин внизу.. какой-то конкретно заказной фарм.компаниями список,буприк - зло и если в/в долго принимать сердце разъест
леривон отдала, а ламиктал (ламотриджин) ещё лежит. заберите, пожалуйста!
@lotos_3 @Loly_girl Лучше по назначению и под присмотром, меня от прозака штырило спать не могла,  другим хорошо. Пришлось менять на велаксин. Все индивидуально
Многие рэперы погибают от наркотиков, но главное чтоб Паша Техник не ушел от ксанакса, веселый озорной, тогда умрет андер и маска гориллы.
#amazing  #bestoftheday  #swag   сейзар инструкция по применению
Не пила толком алкоголь уже две недели. Потому что цифран ст.
випила эутирокс, стимулон, велерьянку и глицин вместе плиз тревога уходи
@asersonus Можно пить эгилок 25 мг с кофе 👍
О, я хлеб тоже давно не ела. А потом села на паксил и теперь снова ем - потому что на всё пофиг.
вы: ламотриджин я, интеллектуал: альпакодваджейм
Смекта, уголь и лоперамид третий день, ммм кайфую
Нашла совершенно удивительную аптеку, в которой нет левотироксина производства Берлин-Хеми, зато есть Глюкофаж 500. Поразительно, обычно первый есть вообще везде, а второго с огнём не сыщешь
я уже проверилась, она говорит что нужно пить сиоФор и витамин д 3 месяца,затем повторно сдать анализы и только потом паниковать
@MadgunRus значит "стул" не  изменился, пусть " Имодиум" примет..
кветиапин только по рецепту, штоты. это очень сильная штука. фенибут покупала без.
Смелый краб! Я несколько недель назад читал отличное исследование влияния прозака на популяцию крабов: они вымирают, охуев от храбрости!
это лож флуоксетин-то я хавала но передозировки у меня никогда не было
Форадил Комби. Кому нужен ? Целые 2 упаковки
Рановато ещё, наверное, снижать Кветиапин, но я попробую потестить. Если будет ебано, вернусь на прежнюю дозировку.
Каждый раз, когда мне нужен вентолин, он пропадает из сумки. Как не задохнуться, гугл поиск.
Рексетин!!! Полнолуния головного мозга поет целый день и краснеет, я плачу, сплю и плачу.
Приём метформина день 8й: кажись я потеряла килограмм за пару дней. Бред какой-то, быть не может
Фенозепам в жопу, фенозепам с флуоксетином в рот, а сверху ещё квентиапином шлифануть. Живу как король.
Нашла на просторах ютуба просто залипая на бантанов. Используйте Имодиум, Чимин плохого не посоветует👌 #BTS #btscrack #JHOPE #JIMIN https://t.co/qaqbEeTzWf
Флоуксетин - это прозак. Ешьте, вам нужно.
Таблетки, таблетки, таблетки.. Я снова закидываюсь паксилом..
Я в курсе, меня больше интересует (метформин)
Бупренорфин – мощное обезболивающее средство при онкологии, систематических и постоянных болях. По анальгетической активности превосходит Морфин. При увеличении дозы обезболивающий эффект не нарастает;
Приснилось, шо закинулся ксанаксом в аптеке.
сегодня пришлось дважды утром симбикорт принимать
блин я не могу жрать метформин утром и вечером потому что Я НИХУЯ НЕ ЕМ НИ УТРОМ НИ ВЕЧЕРОМ а если жрать его без еды жкт пошлёт на хуй
у меня для этого сиозам и прозак, но не откажусь для дополнительной порции
Здравствуйте! Подскажите, пожалуйста- можно ли принимать Габапентин (Gabapentin) не в капсуле, а высыпать в ложку и запить водой. Просто у человека горло очень узкое и капсула не проходит. И как принимать еду- до или после ( или вместе) ?
Просто картинка описывающая все аспекты моей жизни. Только,жаль, глицин, афобазол и иже с ними мне уже не помогают А флуоксетин ( вроде верно написала) уже без рецепта не продают
все это может вести к развитию серьезных заболеваний вроде диабета. в моем случае, например прием рисперидона повысил холестерин и ухудшил тахикардию, а оланзапин добавил 10кг и я прямо ощущал как тупею с каждой минутой все больше и больше.
На сайте аптеки в "хитах продаж" таблетки для снижения веса Порциола и  противодиарейный препарат Имодиум

Перестройку кончим так: мелаксен, анальгин, прозак!
то самое чувство когда у тебя весенние обострение и на тебя подписывается  фенозепам и флуоксетин
Крепист чел! Иди к психиатру, пей паксил, станет проще. Позже появится силы! Думаю, у тебя все получится, сама в таком дерьме живу.
я под ксанаксом за 800, а без ксанакса - за 1500
кстати ксанакс полная хуйня не рекомендую
Гомеопатия - это жизнь Лечите онкологию содой, не прогадаете Какой осельтамивир? Попейте лучше оциллококцинум👌 https://t.co/bn6N27j6c9
Эриспал лишь муколитик, замена которому легко находится среди целой линейки других препаратов,предназначенных для разжижения мокроты. Вентолин -адреномиметик- бронхоспазмолитик, применяемый для купирования синдрома бронхиальной обструкции различной этиологии
делаю ингаляцию с вентолином. после него сердце будет стучать будто после четырех чашек кофе
ФЛУОКСЕТИН ТЫ МОЙ ПОСЛЕДНИЙ ШАНС
Мне выписали флуоксетин, психотерапевт сказал, что с алкоголем нужно просто экспериментировать и понять свою реакцию
@moskvit1960 @ChoShto Я ни за что не стану с Вами спорить. 850Вы всегда этого хотите. А я не люблю"боевые действия". У меня мама 6,5 лет назад умерла в возрасте 70,5лет До этого она жила 10 л. слепой и с порезом желудка.У неё было 5-6 уколов в день!!! И 3 р.в день1/2 Метформин 850 - я знаю об этом ВСЁ
Я АРХАНГЕЛ ГАВРИИЛ ПОГУБИЛ БОЛЬШЕ РОК-ЗВЕЗД ЧЕМ КСАНАКС И ГЕРОИН
Купила в аптеке дефицитный Тамифлю.
нормотимик и антиконвульсант ламотриджин под македонской торговой маркой сейзар разбавлен таким количеством подсластителя сахаринат натрия и черносмородинного ароматизатора что никакой вольчек не нужен
да у меня тож сальбутамол ( вентолин ) от приступов, а на постоянной то на ночь каждый день фликсотид ( флютиказона пропионат ) такие дела
@_dn_ru бабушка амлодипин пьет, мама с папой - коптопрес и берлиприл. Иногда Эгилок. Что там за действующие вещества - я не знаю.
и да, пить с прозаком реально не стоит, совершенно невозможно встать с утра
@KissMyBlacklist а не лечатся ли их футболисты от астмы, синдрома дефицита внимания и т.п. столь любимыми у нероссийских спортсменов "законными" амфетамином и декстроамфетамином?  а?🤨
Если бы Паша Техник был наставником команды батл-мц, он назвал бы её "Ксанаксы" Потому что когда Ксанакса много, он захуярит даже тигра
Лектор говорит “оксикодон”  Не могу не улыбнуться)
Какой прозак блять. 2 дороги утром и побежал хуярить на работу. Вечером вместо еды батл коньяка и по новой. Треньки блядь. Зож.
@hiroshimamylove Закинул под язык полтора колеса ксанакса Унылый вид из окна сапсана
бладборн способен воскресить вашу нервную систему даже после кветиапина
Отсутствуют как класс противовирусные,  недавно исчез имодиум,  ничего похожего на энтерсогель не было. Уголь есть за дорооого
Потому что иначе нельзя или потому что я могу? Х&amp;Й ЗНАЕТ. БИТ ПУТАЕТ МЫСЛИ КАК ПРОЗАК  (я не смог не)
Только ради гречки и ксанакса
Каким бы успешным и знаменитым ты не стал в России, в итоге все равно придется рекламировать Сеалекс
Слезла с прозака,мозги выходят из тумана и требуют информации.теперь параллельно читаю Маркеса,Сартара и Прачетта
Вообще забавная херня была, как к нам эта вещь попала. Крч один чувак расплатился с нами за услугу. Дал сотку и 70 колес этого кветиапина. 70, Карл. Откуда они у него были Я хз, тк их вроде без рецепта не продают
блять я сейчас злая пиздец ещё и вспомнила, как контр блядский называл флуоксетин не флу, а фло сука, тебя нужно ебалом об бетонный фло ебануть
прозак или флуоксетин в простанародье называется) дешево и сердито. постоянно состояние счастливой свиньи
Наташ, может таблетки попить от депрессии? Тот же прозак, а?
у отца короче депрессия уже с конца лета. он постоянно подходит ко мне со словами «посиди со мной, только не ругай». ма на него орет, что он специально не отвечает на вопросы, а он чуть ли не плачет. лечили от селфхарма, а получили это. флуоксетин сука.
цифран ст и есть ципролет а. фу, пиздец
@kilates_twt @tomlinson0_mary ну вообще то ему вместо ксанакса продали какое то более сильное дерьмо, он не знал об этом, принял свою обычную дозу и откинулся опять же, если ты не знаешь всего, завали ебальник ::)
Флуоксетина нет, но вы держитесь.
Да ладно, оланзапин это проверенная временем классика. Его бы не назначали так часто будь все так пиздецово
Лучший подарок мне подарил напарник: 2 колеса лоперамида
я в твоей голове будто червь-паразит разливаюсь в венах будто ВЕНЛАФАКСИН
Пачка паксила, снова стал добрым Он гипнотизирует меня, словно глаза кобры Бак полный, значит газ в пол, и Хэникен познал злобу
нет ничего ебанутее, чем люди, которые жрут флуоксетин, чтобы излечиться от депрессии, блядь
На аналогах прозака. а прозак от недаеба
Созданы антибиотики группы ципрофлоксацина, не попадающие в окружающую среду
И что характерно - ни капли сальбутамола!
На этапе "Тур де Ски" болельщики вывесили плакат против использующих вентолин спортсменов
Сейчас столько «фанатья» Тентасьона вылезет что пиздануться. Это как с прошлогодним передозом Лил.. как его там? Памп? пимп? Ну тот пацан с татуировками на ебале под ксанаксом, помните? Короче.. того белого не жалко он бесталанный был и выпилился как сука
Единственный плюс вставать рано — можно посмотреть больше серий сериала, пока меня не унесёт на волнах кветиапина в одиннадцать вечера
А я теряю водуууууу  серьёзно, надоело уже. ещё немного, и я начну лоперамид жрать.
Ну что за детский сад Я полгода на пароксетине провела и не спрашивала А как амик назначили, так сразу пошла проверять  Я шучу, я ебанутая, не делайте так   пожалусто
@twenty Про тамифлю есть много наглядных примеров ,где со своевременным приемом препарата течение заболевания было в лайтовой форме. Я сейчас про грипп А
Такое ощущение что я на ебаном флуоксетине как те анорексички..
После нескольких дней отнюдь не светских вечеринок хочется просто раздолбить пару таблов прозака и не ебаться с южали херней
читаю как кветиапин влияет на пролактин и думаю что надо было идти учиться на эндокринолога (очень интересно и сложно)
хочу ксанакс перкоцет оксикодон прометазин кодеин
Ахаха западный реп поёт про ксанакс, наши реперы про кетонал)
Если без шуток, то какого-нибудь фестала, креона, аллохола зохавай, чтобы не выбило дно опять жощщ, плюс имодиум
Дуров принял Прозак и начал разговаривать. Иногда просто ненавижу быть правым.
Кодеин, трамадол, прегабалин. Детка, я в говно. Так каждый день детка я с тобой - Пока молодой, пока молодой.
@xiuminiiiiiii @o2xsunny Купи драмину и лоперамид У меня были две такие же проблемы каждый раз когда гоняли в Новороссийск В этот раз я как только села закинулась и доехала ахуэнно
бит как у ксанакса техника
Боюсь, что скоро понадобится баллончик сальбутамола.
Явный психоз, без шуток. Седативные нужно попринимать. И габапентин в придачу. Или по ебалу.
риталин, аддерал, виванс, декседрин в основном
Самая грязная работа у лоперамида, знаете ли
Кветиапин прекрасен, но нам пора расстаться  Ну и мой новый друг тиаприд это гарантированно юбилейный за вот эти вот великолепные 7 месяцев подбора лекарств-10? 15? Кто его знает  Но рецептами я точно смогу оклеить уже одну стену
Чудо, как хорошо работать в аптеке, потому что можешь позволить себе всё. Флуоксетин для похудения, ципрамил для настроения, атаракс для засыпания, фенибут для обучения. Ещё один большущий плюс- я знаю как все это комбинировать, заменять, чередовать
- этот самый, который в одежде мылся, как его? Ибрагим - дура, эвкалипт - айболит? - лоперамид
@tass_agency Наконец, невозможно, один фалисификат, привыкли пить лекарство, сменили яко-бы коробку, но внутри, выпив еле отшли, что за убийство людей, это  Энам, Ципролет, Анаприлин белая коробка, нюхать невозможно, ацетон, бегаем ищем старый, нет. Это не в Индии, а в РФ изготовление.
Сап ночной сосач. Как избавиться от действия габапентина? заебала эта вялость, а спать ложится страшно, вообще не понимаю почему
Получил зп за прошлую неделю и накупил на нее сальбутамол и хавчика. Денег снова нет, но теперь ЦЕЛУЮ НЕДЕЛЮ НЕ БУДУ ГОЛОДНЫМ АХУЕТЬ
Я бы с радостью возобновила курс флуоксетина
Контрабанду капсул для похудания с запрещенным сибутрамином пресекли на таможенном посту в Забайкалье
Ахаха не увидим больше рекламы сеалекса и али капса перед матчами. Вдруг нашли что-то запрещенное))
Привет, подписчики!!!!! Кто тусуется на антидепрессантах?) посоветуйте что-нибудь типо флуоксетина)))))))
Одногруппники скинули видео с сообщением "вылитая ты" ожидание: какая-нибудь милота реальность: телка, которую судили за хранение ксанакса, сказала судье adiós, а потом послала всех нахуй
- а какая правильная модель поведения, если ты чем-то недоволен? - возьми ксанакса или барбитуры жёсткой. забудешь, что ты чем-то недоволен
короче,в инструкции к веропомилу я прочитала:в сочетании с метопрололом возможен летальный исход(почитайте сами,если кто не верит
6. ИНФЛЮЦЕИН то, чем мне заменили Тамифлю ебучее.  Помогло вроде, хороший препарат, после него не тошнило. Хотя почти то же самое, что тот первый, но вот так вот

Главное не миксовать с сероквелью)
если будешь в Москве, могу подарить афобазол и неск. табл. кветиапина (продается по рецепту, от психозов)

Сальбутамол. Мама опять просит запомнить название чего-то
@Apolinariya_ *когда пытаешься оправдать зачем тебе флуоксетин* )))))))
Мониторьте своё состояние внимательно, Саша, что не так - сразу к врачу. Иногда АД меняют. (По себе знаю, от Венлафаксина эпично блевала, не смогла пить.)
Я уже не вхожу в возрастную группу, где флуоксетин может вызвать суицидальные тенденции. Мне их и без флу хватает :D
не угостите ли даму пачечкой флуоксетина
И вообще по отзывам кто-то от рексетина сильно худеет, кто-то толстеет, а кто-то просто остаётся как был. Ну мне повезло)
Есть вентолин. Он немного слабее. Но если выписали, то лучше купить беродуал.
аналогом американской нации прозака станет российская нация афобазола похоже
Я прошла целый квест и таки получила рецепт на свой заветный ксанакс, это конечно надо было видеть но мне похуй, я же упорная и упоротая не так ли
Кэрри Фишер похоронили в урне в виде капсулы прозака, а меня можно будет высыпать в баночку колы.
@RainVera а если серьёзно, то Донормил в помощь) а если прям совсем серьёзно, то Триттико (но это уже больше антидепрессант)
Продается 1 блистер (пластинка, 14 таблеток) Ксарелто (Xarelto), дозировка 20 мг. / Производитель: BAYER PHARMA AG..
Аноны, я пью третий год антидепрессанты "Флуоксетин". На днях задумался, что не принимать же мне их всю жизнь. Какие могут быть последствия после долгого их приема? И как вообще можно их бросить пить? Аноны, кто связывался или кто сидит на АД, может что
@h_a_l_w_i о, мне тоже его прописывали, его и алпразолам флуоксетин хороший
что ж у вас все со срачкой то связано?! Лоперамид в помощь
- я стану вторым лил пипом - будешь копировать его стиль? - нет, у меня будет передозировка ксанаксом
Ога, он самый. Говорят, сходить с венлафаксина так же трудно, как с героина лол
Я зак, а ты прозак
@iwanttechnique При всем уважении Павел Делать вам там нехуй Ps: Ксанакс отпусти
@ivanovoobl Господа чиновники из Департамента здравоохранения! Что-то странное творится с закупками лекарств для диабетиков! Уже второй месяц в 7-й пол-ке не выдают ни Галвуса или Янувии! Не закупили! Почему? И как быть больным? Цена на эти препараты очень "кусается"!
капец тупые дауны они бы еще ксанакс начали жрать
@Napoleon_6 Кселода 14540 руб, Крестор 4483 руб, Брилинта 4927 руб. Это только три лекарства а их больше десятка. На пенсию купишь?
@poebist @double_crab @upgrade16121 @Roof_Zenith @paravouzique @black_headed @mojet_ne_nado Золофт, тразодон 🤷🏻‍♀️  Надо еще что-нибудь для сна.
У МЕНЯ ЩА ВОЗНИКЛА ИДЕЯ В ГОЛОВЕ: Подружиться с девушкой по имени Оксана и называть ее Ксанакс
сибутрамин спасёт. Но он по рецептам.
Друзья, подарите мне на выпускной пачку презервативов, чтобы защищаться от мудаков и пару пачек флуоксетина, пожалуйста!
@8htEcuvcvgLWUEb ксанакс - не выход, прозак - тоже. терпеть.
Не потянет.Тока по санитарному "Опелю" и упаковочке "Тамифлю".
Тамифлю - он же озельтамивир , прямое противовирусное против штамов гриппа А и В, которые реально были тогда и реально нать сейчас !!!!
отдам кветиапин (кетилепт), почти полная упаковка, кондей 7/10 СПб, но можно и переслать если что!
@Ravenallo4ka Спасибо, Алла! Нет другого врача. Поэтому я и здесь🙂 Софрадекс боюсь. Сейчас про нормакс и офтаквикс прочту. Пока склоняюсь к анаурану, т.к ничего не знаю про целостность перепонки.
Мне тупо лень дышать турбухалером, пить таблетки и мерить давление
Врач сказал, что щитовидку мою надо выкинуть на помойку и посадил на вечный курс левотироксина. Заебись.
Все эти слюнтяи, утверждающие, будто суицид-удел слабых людей, найдут тысячу причин не глотать горсть прозака.Им просто не хватает смелости.
а спонсор моей силы воли - сибутрамин. сибутрамин - 20 часов ебашим и 4 спим сибутрамин - на этой неделе я уже ел осторожно, возможный побочный эффект - сверхчеловек
Котики, вы невероятные. Сегодня купила Габагамму 300 по рецепту (33.3р), оплачу передержку до следующей субботы включительно и ещё остаётся половина или две третьих суммы на стерилку, в зависимости от прайса клиники. Всем мур❤️ https://t.co/NlDsSVaVK0
Удивительно, второй день на конюшне без супрастина, сальбутамола и капель от насморка
причины ненависти к кветиапину: 1. вырубает вечером аки пиздец 2. смог проснуться - герой 3. СРЫВАЕТКРЫШУЧУВСТВУЕШЬНЕПОНЯТНОЧТОДНЕМ + апатия
мне кажется наша физичка сидит на оксикодоне
Тетя увидела, как я пью флуоксетин Т: а что будет если ты перестанешь пить антидепрессанты? Я: это секрет Т: расскажи Я /подсаживаюсь ближе и делаю максимально серьезное лицо/: я буду кататься по полу в истерике и плеваться пеной Я еще никогда не видела такого испуганного лица
Купил здесь пшена марки "Прозапас"(sic!) и, разумеется, читаю постоянно как "Прозак". Ребёнок, воспитанный современной американской культурой
Скажи мне, кто твой друг, и я скажу где ксанакс  Делу время, а ксанакс берет через 1.5 часа  7 раз отмерь - 1 раз нужен ксанакс  Бесплатный ксанакс бывает только в мышеловке  так ну всё, пора завязывать
Решил попробовать уснуть без кветиапина @ Не уснул @ Отличное начало рабочей недели
@lifenews_ru а что, могли бы попробовать? а вдруг (без сеалекса):))))
Заторможенность игроков Крыльев теперь можно объяснить тем, что они на ксанаксе
Ну что могу сказать девочки Самое время заменять Мальборо айкосом, а спиды - ксанаксом
тут слезами не поможешь. лечение. планомерное и внимательное, регулярные анализы на ТТГ и прочую ебалу. на худой конец посадят на копеечный и действенный эутирокс, ничего страшного. зато настроение нормализуется.
@slowly_pig Флуоксетин Ну хз у меня не такая тяжёлая форма чтобы пить что-то сильнее этого
Выпила увеличенную дозу кветиапина и меня прям вырубает.

Дошли руки послушать новый альбом Ланы.  Ух.  Короче, там есть трек НА ДЕВЯТЬ С ПОЛОВИНОЙ МИНУТ с какими-то дымными психоделическими соляками, как если бы Jefferson Airplain вместо ЛСД как следует навернули прозака с мелаксеном. https://t.co/OgV2gRiRgX
Сука бляяяя, рука болит, лицо болит (спасибо пилинг), фен и паксил мне НЕ ПОМОГАЮТ, как спать-непонятно. #Goodnightmotherfucker
Зато теперь у меня есть рецепт на 300 капсул флуоксетина.
