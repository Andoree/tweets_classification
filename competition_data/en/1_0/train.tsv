1	when they had me on risperdal, paxil, lunesta &amp; xanax, i couldn't feel a god-damn thing emotionally, i hated that. i'm an anti-drug activist
1	do i come off my medication or do i just continue to be a prozac zombie
1	the day after humira used to be a great one, full of energy, low pain. after a month, it is now a fatigue filled achy day. #rheum
1	@phdrawanalahdal @saudi_pharma_07 @pharmd_sawsan no, digoxin is the right answer. because ranolazine cause hypotension
1	@jenifermeer we sure do. or new treatments. i'm on humira now. remicade almost killed me.
1	ugh! the cramps from these atorvastatin are awful
1	@missalexisk 8 months of no treatment. went back to my original rheumy and she's trying to get me back on remi. i was allergic to enbrel

1	this nuvaring gives me the worst cramps all month long 😥
1	took this oxycodone on an empty stomach lmaoooo i'm so fucking high
1	also so glad they gave me percocets instead of t3s. oxycodone helps so much more than codeine. inb4 opiate withdrawels though.
1	rt @uffelanie: just wondering where the side effect of hating the world is stated on vyvanse advertisements?
1	@itsmecreezy i hate to hear that.  taking seroquel is like swallowing a sleeping pill when u wake up then trying to function normally

1	i dislike the way metformin makes my chest feel. like there's a tightness. #diabetes
1	do any of my friends who take pristiq have problems with nausea? ):
1	@thehausofkunte i was on methotrexate side effects were awful now i'm on enbrel and it kills me to say its not as good as methotrexate !
1	going off paxil cr cold turkey is something you should never ever do if you value your brain cells.
1	minus the skin reactions, this week i can say i think enbrel is helping :-) #yaforbiologics #rasucks
1	why does tapering down lamotrigine feel as yucky as stepping it up? #soreashell
1	dissociative fugues &amp; loss of empathy since age 11, serious cardio problems since age 14, almost dying of paxil withdrawal @ 21, that's a-ok
1	you don't know insomnia until you take 2 seroquel and work out at 3am.

1	@jasondominy thanks for sharing, dude! have you had issues w/nausea from strattera? i’m in a debate b/w that and vyvanse re: side effects
1	@michaelhirtzel wow &amp; i thought enbrel burned.
1	@jenniferannhatc i understand bystolic does mess with losing weight, but i've still slowly pulled it off. the ptu is a new challenge now.
1	@sabvintagehome @thepapers @itcomesitgoes i'd like to dream about his hair.  unfortunately with the synthroid i only have wtf?! dreams.
1	there's a point where you know when trazodone has kicked in. it's when you're a drunk, staggering, blurry-eyed, amnesic. yeah. i'm there now
1	a mixture of diazepam and temazepam to make myself sleep was maybe not the greatest idea. i feel like the whole world is spinning around me.
1	if i put my head down in class and my profs yell at me i'm just gonna scream about how much i dislike viibryd so far
1	i really feel like this fluoxetine is messing with my perspective time and people.
1	cymbalta tore up our stress incontinence agreement first!  it’s like niagara falls when i cough.
1	do you think ms or tysabri effects teeth.  the enamel or you get more toothaches ?
1	my hopes &amp; dreams of my itchy legs totally fading with new synthroid dose has been crushed. back with a vengeance &amp; literally in tears.

1	@hotmessbritt thanks seeing rheumy april 15, i just think i maxed out my neurontin &amp; it's not working anymore:/

1	@wearebipolar saphris is the one that finally knocked me into feeling stable (of course now i'm up at 3:45 am and not sleeping) #bpdchat
1	@icedborscht i take metformin because i have to, and it works. but it also makes me unable to tolerate much alcohol, and that part i hate.
1	are you depressed? are you anxious? do you like headaches and diarrhea? if you answered yes to the last one, then viibryd is right for you!
1	@actualdoctor i'm trying to go off it. i'm on lamictal now and it works but i'm still addicted to geodon
1	studies show that acomplia weight loss pills increases the risk of suicidal thoughts and suicidal acts
1	idk if i'm shaking because i took adderall or if it's because i drank 2 red bulls within 20 minutes earlier

1	okay my doctor tried to perscribe me strattera instead of adderall and i couldn't tell him that strattera doesn't work ugh
1	@vowsloveandlace consider nuvaring or orthomicronor (the mini pill) bc they both cause less weight gain!
1	today's pristiq withdrawal symptom: my eyeballs make a sound like star trek doors when i move them. #wtf
1	@kniterrupted i'm gonna have to switch meds again bc the viibryd gives me awful gi side effects.

1	probably gonna up my dosage on the paxil...head still hurting a week later. goddamn migraines. please go away.

1	i do wonder of that achille's will ever recover fully from the cipro.
1	well it only takes about 15 hits of my albuterol inhaler to get the congestion out of my lungs caused by my new g pen ... what gives?
1	@reneeliedig hi idk who you are but i just wanted to let you know i gained over 20 lbs on paxil. be watchful.
1	@obfusticate whoa, on the topamax?! the saphris is what causes my nighttime craziness (haha), topamax cuts off the cravings, keeps me in bed

1	man i got oxycodone for my wisdom teeth and guess what, it makes me hyper not chill.
1	@heyitsnehali i spoke to my consultant about this and he said a lot of people get panic attacks as a side effect of humira and infliximab.
1	feel proud of myself for writing up my august favourites today even though i had my tysabri infusion and feel like shit. #bbloggers
1	coming off 150mg venlafaxine over 14 days was a better idea in discussion. my brain feels like its actually vibrating! #willpower

1	@blessiepooo ohgawd i keep reading/hearing about metformin diarrhea horror stories lol

1	@8dcboy22 @cowboysgoddess i tried advair yrs ago....did nothing for me. i just use the rescue inhaler n singular. no real probs in 5-6yrs
1	@jerilowrance @msozhild good luck. i went the aubagio route. so far so good. feel better. i think tysabri was hurting my joints. 💜 less pain
1	i feel like the nuvaring is making me super bitchy
1	aciphex is product pronounced "ass-effects" &amp; whose possible side-effects include gas, infection &amp; constipation. that cracks me up
1	@bodoyle hmmm....i had a prescription for dexilant that stopped helping after about a month. maybe i'll ask about that...
1	day 6 cold turkey from effexor. i bellevue this pic adequately represents my descent into madness. or whatever. http://t.co/v7miglato6

1	why is it that people take gabapentin for recreational use. dose increase is making me hyperactive. will have clean house but broken body!
1	@negativedrew @katrahigher pristiq gave me sexual side effects but celexa's fine, and if i gain 40lbs it'll be all ass, i've been there lol
1	@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand lexapro gave me the worst mixed episodes. i have some instability with pristiq but i can manage it ok.
1	@furyofpatience i was fine w/ effexor. paxil/seroxat/paroxetine was the worst fucking bitch ad  i've ever withdrawn from. pure evil.
1	venlafaxine hangover finally starting to shift after 2 huge mugs of hot water with giant pieces of lemon...
1	i finally had an appetite, made food, gone. humira why won't you let me eat
1	the albuterol  making me sleepy😴
1	@squadinho infliximab worked for only a short time, humira wasn't effective at all, i suffer from crohns and uc. there's only one real cure

1	@ellacoffeebean i was on both, effexor 1st, it stopped working 4 me &amp; changed to pristiq that worked better. finding the right dosage is key
1	@lithiumlibgirl thank you!  i hope i don't have an allergic reaction like saphris and zyprex. choking is no fun.
1	"@availzal: i'm feeling pretty good for only having one hour of sleep" adderall will do that to ya.
1	@dougcarter4 get well soon, sir. levaquin did a number on my joints a few years back.
1	young nigga just gave me a 70mg vyvanse, these things can twerk me out thank goodness for my script of xanax
1	@jackiemenwa the injectables do. was very sick with betaseron. baclofen is a pill and it just makes me drowsy like gabapentin for nerve pain
1	i'm tired of being tired, deffinatly #nap time for this girl. stupid #medications #paxil #trazodone #seroquel
1	day seven off the baclofen and i've got cold sweats and constant insomnia... i'm running on fumes at this point.

1	@jesjosie lmao. i loved geodon until i started passing out in public and losing chunks of  my day. it was good when it was good, though.
1	@lanternlizard cymbalta switch is part of what made me flip. but any snri with family hx of mania puts you at risk.
1	i hate how vyvanse makes me over think everything and it makes me angry about things that i shouldn't even be angry about
1	@noveldevice @fracturcritical @colorlessblue @graceishuman @blackamazon i'm fine w/ advair &amp; flonase. prednisone = rage monster.
1	@kirkby007 if u r on #humira and have respiratory probs - see ur doc.  that;s how it all started of me.  be well.  nice chatting,
1	i wish i hadn't taken levaquin and prednisone right before bed. #insomniacentral #stupidmedicines
1	@sicklestrong word to the wise: don't swallow cipro at all!!!  it is poison and can cripple you for life!  is your situation life or death?
1	took my enbrel yesterday so of course i broke fever today. of fucking course. is it even worth it? :/
1	@musdiddie @utdforcolitis my parents had to pick between remicade or humira. plus my docs added methotrexate. both remicade &amp; humira failed.
1	today was hard - arguing with a professional. was told seroquel doesn’t make you put on weight - i and my extra 20kg beg to differ.
1	just wondering where the side effect of hating the world is stated on vyvanse advertisements?

1	woo it's so awesome when my adderall makes me have a rapid heart rate when i run so i look like i'm about to have a heart attack
1	looking for alternative tx for severe insomnia after long convalescence.  lunesta no longer working.
1	@lisabrownphotos consider yourself lucky if all it does is make you dizzy and sick!  cipro crippled me and countless others.
1	@inkyworld why i came off it. gp told me its not dangerous but it is damn unpleasant. at least i know it's the quetiapine that's causing it
1	suboxone so clutch, but that orange after taste instant death
1	achilles tendon rupture is a side effect of fluoroquinolones #fact stay away from cipro!!!!

1	metformin in my system makes me wanna puke. 🙊
1	@nirebryce thanks. there is a nonzero chance that the discomfort i am feeling was caused by going back on cymbalta, possibly too quickly.

1	my enbrel shots hurt a lot less than my back but i still dread them. my brain makes no sense. lol.
1	@_connectedcare the first 2 weeks on enbrel i was ravenous, ate everything in sight. 6 months on, but not anymore. i am also type 1 diabetic
1	@kalmsivi saying that, the whole reason i gained weight in the first place was due to the drug olanzapine. doctor's fault. ah well.
1	kinda worried about the nighttime jaw clenching from effexor, what with my tongue ring and all... :l
1	@caffeinatedmama i took it so long that i have a tolerance. requested lunesta last time and it works even less than ambien.
1	the one bummer about it all is that the fluoxetine is giving me the shakes which made fine fiddly detail work harder than it should be

1	put half a tube of diclofenac on my back and i'm still in agony 😣

1	@mrjdscott p.s. the meds w/their sideffects are not good. when i was on lunesta i drank a bottle of peroxide &amp; became violently ill. not fun
1	i can always tell when the etonogestrel hormone starts being released because my face starts breaking out.. #bcproblems

1	@tweetingpotter gabapentin and amitryptylinr made me very drowsy! propanalol made me dizzy (but i have very low blood pressure!).
1	i'm so allergic to trazodone but i haven't been taking it so no one believes me :::---))))

1	pregabalin has made me twitch and have little muscle spasms, it has reduced pain but i think my twitch is drawing attention
1	i couldn't remember if i took a vyvanse or not early so i took another one &amp;now i'm spazzing out... bc obviously i took one already😫😖 #adhd
1	ah the sting of the #humira injection. how i've not missed thee. #ankylosing #spondylitisq #ouch
1	personally i prefer staying up until i get hallucinations, to taking seroquel to get to sleep, but only because it's more fun for me
1	doctors, why am i more wheezy since starting ventolin and flovent ? i want to be able to breathe again.  #doctors #help
1	but yeah, that geodon totally fucked me up and i became a pain as a result. a whiny pain i'll add but it was also druggies and some white
1	@jennniff i didn't take a zopiclone in the end.. but i'm third day of no quetiapine &amp; i'm eating incredibly differently!
1	please be careful when withdrawing from any anti deps, benzos and/or hypnotics. venlafaxine was a bad choice for me and worse withdrawl.
1	@nuttybrunette_x ... gabapentin can cause you to get very hungry. just be prepared. amitriptyline...just ease slowly and use a low dose.
1	ugh, lunesta has the worst aftertaste ever. forgot to use my peppermint oil tonight. =.(

1	@curlycrohnie yeah, remicade and humira both caused me extra trouble. methotrexate didn't work and it also made me feel a lot worse.
1	@mrjordyfranco i was on that before i started enbrel &amp; methotrexate. it didn't really help my arthritis but hopefully it helps you out
1	vimpat makes me exhaugsted!!
1	@amymartin3334 it's very hard to find good medication combo that works.. i'm currently on remicade :) humira didn't work for me

1	@paulibz @wenhellfreezes just pregabalin (higher dose than before), ibruprofen &amp; esomeprazole but combination zonks me out.

1	@forbesmerck's  vioxx was rushed through by the fda, too - and killed my husband. testing results were distorted, hidden. fda was complicit.

1	@miratorazh doc gave me ventolin this round because it's $20 cheaper than my proventil but it doesn't work as well for me &gt;.&lt;

1	@anitaalibi paxil didn't end up helping. tried prozac and wellbutrin and it helped my mood and anxiety but gave me vertigo. :(
1	@renbobs prozac is the bartering stage. tell them it's not working. do not say "friends say duloxetine is like being on e 44 hours a day".
1	@gothlaw @whduncan i can't tolerate it either, same for codeine and all its other cousins. darvocet is where it's at.
1	im delaying on taking my geodon so i can stay up late 😎😎😎😎😎

1	@ccfa ok i need help: crohns, full proctocolectomy w ileostomy w reversal remicade not working, so does humira work?
1	@nuaansw it's disgusting how they portray it, i delayed starting methadone for far too long when suboxone wasn't working because of stigma.
1	@andyjruns ventolin does nothing at all for me - taking other stuff @morrison_sal

1	@nickisheader @cure_pa @parthritis @psoriaticarthri had my weekly etanercept last night. working better for me than methotrexate did #nausea

1	@christal_l yeah, that was a great fucking year. that's when paxil entered my life, and made it worse. 10 years time sure helps, though.
1	@crohnscolitis18  both, humira and remicade doesn't help, so i think an operation and a stoma or how do you call it in english?

1	i think that vyvanse is making me grind my teeth...
1	@houlejeannine @missnikitaquinn oh yeah!  i was on fentanyl but it numbed my brain 2 much. buprenorphine is helping me better w/o making...
1	well......well damn. i used to take ventolin but it didn't do anything for me. i told my doctor that i had to have symbicort @_alyssahayes
1	@themethmaze yeah, you'll suffer no matter what. i would say suboxone withdrawal is worse than methadone, but both are pretty horrible.
1	i was so excited to go see animals and hang with my friend and his son but i can't stop puking. fucking suboxone
1	@letti4u :( i'm sorry to hear that. i had a side effect from humira that negated all tnf blockers so no enbrel for me either. :( #rheum

1	@_cimmy_ thanks! yes, after i was prescribed cipro a few years ago, and it really messed me up, i am quite wary of broad spectrum ones.
1	@notgaydalek @anarchistdalek @blucrystaldalek januvia could make you hungry though. and irritable. hangry.
1	@chloeconure that is surely possible but sometimes the tamiflu does not work

1	@stinkings @evilbadgerette trazodone was evil. turned you all flat :(
1	enbrel is literally the worst part of my week. it hurts soooo bad!!! #arthritisprobs

1	@nikki_isabel lexapro made me lethargic but also affected my sleep (insomnia) and had a few other issues. taking pristiq now, works for me.

1	so, i lasted 16 days on seroquel. i couldn't handle the awful side effects. constantly dizzy and lightheadeded &amp; a myriad of other bad stuff
1	don't ever take a vyvanse and drink an energy drink. your heart will explode
1	i've got no motivation for things today.   guess my amount of lunesta i took is still in my system.
1	@rraaaaachel @nuvaringtruth crazy isnt it!? i had a blood clot in each lung on xarelto for 6mos! scary stuff #survivors ;)
1	@kjothesmartass this suboxone is making me gain weight. i don't know why. but i don't like it. im still active so i don't get it
1	totally down with possible decreased appetite/decreased weight side effect of this pristiq tbh
1	a lot of the time coming off adderall makes me feel like i have done molly a day or two ago.
1	@rbhu7_82 if i don't take my quetiapine i can stay awake for days!
1	does anybody else take metformin and has a horrible taste in his mouth?
1	@sydj1405 i couldn't tolerate it so then i went to humira injections. didn't work now i'm on remicade every 6 weeks.

1	@va434sweetie i'm on nuvaring too! my cramps are pretty bad on it too.
1	@redbuttongirl combining them with the quetiapine makes me hallucinate :/
1	i fucking hate advair but it might be what i get put on. the albuterol isn't good for my heart or blood pressure long term.
1	i can't stop yawning #trazodone

1	@basic_chunnel @bromethazine i'm pretty lucid in all my dreams, and the seroquel drowsiness carried over into the dream. lolol.
1	seroquel left me with sleep paralysis. abilify left me with occasional muscle spasms. i've been off of both for nearly a decade.

1	@mrpaulrobinson my missus took diclofenac when she slipped a disc. turned her into gollum overnight

1	i hope buscopan works.... since loperamide and the other one didn't
1	@anarchasxworker coming off effexor was the worst ever. even my doctor was terrified of me doing it but the side effects left me no choice.

1	@ayegraybay i know😔wishful thinking. my humira shot doesn't even work for me anymore and when it does i get so sick.
1	seem to be feeling a bit better. disturbed sleep is a problem though. #venlafaxine #day15
1	@missmazygg anxiety has been so high. but yeah, if your dosage is high its hard to come off. i had to detox from pristiq (its cousin drug)
1	@afterhoursdre i would think so because adderall makes you not want to eat even more? probably get sick maybe
1	about to take 60mg of temazepam aka bezos and see how long i can stay awake should be fun
1	plus: enbrel totally helps with the fatigue. con: enbrel does f*ck all for pain.
