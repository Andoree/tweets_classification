0	Совершенно непонятно почему люди так брезгливо относятся к бутирату и прегабалину, отличные же вещи.  Бутират вообще достаточно полезен, защищает нервные клетки во время гипоксии, а в сочетании с кокаином (или любым другим ингибитором обратного захвата дофамина) очень приятный
0	Приснилось, что у меня была куча маленьких крысят, и я их накормила баклофеном. Что блять.

0	А что же это Вас, сударь, что не скажи, сразу на ассоциации тянет? С этим к докторам, Или таблеточку, на самый худой конец. "Ксанакс" или "Прозак" весьма способствуют.
0	ксанакс это алпразолам, список 3
0	Сны под ксанаксом так удивительны
0	@lyrique221 Но блин, мне его на долго не выпишут. Сказали ещё месяц и все, надо искать альтернативу..  конвалис, аналог, не походит, у меня на него побочки мне бы амитриптилин. Он мне легче всего идёт. У меня почему то на современные препараты побочек много.
0	вот это поворот. может, флуоксетина?

0	Примерный список фармы, которую я пробовала: Кветиапин, пароксетин, эсциталопрам, ламотриджин,, гидроксизин, тофизопам, феназепам. Больше не вспомню. Сейчас кушаю эсциталопрам (антидепрессант) и ламотриджин (нормотимик) каждый день и гидроксизин при тревоге.

0	Однажды меня заебёт моя никчемная жизнь и я куплю много-много атаракса, смешаю его с кетаролом и присыплю паксилом. И запью это вискарем.
1	Пароксетин.  Наконец-то начала видеть сны. Но тяжело просыпаться и постоянно сплю вечером. Хотя режим держался довольно долго (пару недель), сейчас уехал в полные ебеня. Однозначно смешанка, которая помогла мне в тяжёлый момент, когда надо было ебошить
0	Метформин и гликизид сбивает частично. Но всё равно надо корректировать диетой. Или кушать всё,но каждые 3 часа по 200г.Стакан супика,например.

0	Как снотворное сразу. Но лечебный эффект в виде восстановившегося суточного цикла позже, надо курс пропить. Но если сильная бессонница, может не помочь. Мне в свое время только квентиакс помогал, а потом я уже мелаксен начала пить, когда сон как явление вообще появился в жизни)
1	Сдохнуть хочется. От паксила у меня падает давление и болит сердце, а валерьянка не помогает и мне реально очень очень плохо
0	И начала не с 500гр, а с 1000гр. А у меня даже диабет не стоит как диагноз. А у метформина куча побочек и вообще стремно принимать.

1	Блин, да даже от отмены флуоксетина ломает, представляю((( Единственное, от отмены чего меня не ломало - почему-то Велаксин. Он чудесный, мягкий, очень хорошо меня чинил, но, к сожалению, я о него, пардон, блевала дальше, чем видела.

1	Я перепробовал штук 5 разных антидепрессантов, самые дорогие из них мне не помогали вообще, зато, как ни смешно, лучше всего работали самые дешевые. Правда, от одних из них были побочки на печень и постоянная горечь во рту, и в итоге я перешел на печально известный флуоксетин.
0	надо в срочном порядке начинать закидываться флуоксетином
0	Когда я пробовал принимать флуоксетин, где-то на третий день сработал так называемый активирующий эффект. Это было круче любых наркотиков, я был просто счастлив, как никогда счастлив. Был на небе. Потом прошло. Завидую всем этим жизнерадостным оптимистам, знаю какого им.
0	я ненавижу пить ебаный полисорб и фликсоназе  но пожалуйста, хоть бы они щас помогли и я не сдохла
0	Надо: всяко рыльское бильжо вывалить навалом - обработать колом в Жо - чтоб не казалось мало! А после выдать им имодиум и вывести на подиум
0	лучше обойтись половиной бутылки! если много ебошить на паксиле могут быть симптомы передозировки. хочешь много пить - переходи на венлу или золофт, хаха
0	Обязательно! В Москве как были перебои с тем же глиформином - так и есть!
0	кстати если (какое если тебе рецепт уже выписали пиздуй) я начну курс  ламотриджина (если я его найду блин) мне придется не пить пиво и прочие спиртные напитки и мне неловко признаваться что меня это пиздец как расстраивает

0	@naninumo помню ты раньше триттико пила. у меня зависимость уже какая-то от этих таблеток. амитриптилин в основном,а так то лошадиная доза гидазепама на ночь. просто не хочу пить нейролептики
0	удивляюсь, еще не встречал мнения, что для русского человека тоска - абсолютно притягательна, а американец не выдерживает и склонен к приему ксанакса чуть что или суициду.
0	кул, однажды принимал его под названием Триттико, эффект был отличный. Но когда принимал в другой раз через несколько месяцев, ничего не почувствовал.
0	Ну я алпразолам как-то запивал

0	@wrstsnnr Велаксин ужасная мерзость. Я тоже на нем сидела. На него сложно садиться и смерти подобно слезать. Нах ее вообще прописывать?
1	наверное, от велаксина худеют тупо потому что есть, когда тебя так тошнит, просто невозможно (но я не против, ибо с первого раза же почувствовала себя лучше)
0	Я на паксиле и от двух бутылок пива и половины вина вроде было норм,только немного трясло
0	@Lena__FM @bldthrstbtwhl В своё время порылась. Есть только два противовирусных, которые доказали свою клиническую эффективность — тамифлю и реленза. При условии, что пьёшь в первые 48 часов симптомов, и это лишь помогает сократить время болезни (не 7, а 5 дней) и снизить субъективный дискомфорт. Цена🙈
0	Сегодня ночью мне приснился Паша Техник, который угощал меня "Ксанаксом". Интересно, что об этом говорят сонники.
1	@Bubbl_Bitch Кушал паксил года 4. Не представляю как бы функционировал без него. Помог социализироваться и улучшить качество жизни. Получил от препарата все что нужно и я его бросил. Пару месяцев конечно было тяжеловато, но я бы не назвал это привыканием. Сейчас не тянет  его принимать.
0	никто не хочет случайно купить мне флуоксетин и поадить его на нг?
0	Я БЫЛ ПОД КСАНАКСОМ , ЭТО НЕ В СЧЕТ

0	15. мне прописали ламотриджин, но я не рискнула его пить во время сессии, а затем во время отпуска, потому что уже насмотрелась на побочки.  но пару дней назад я начала пить его снова, потому что гипомания кончилась и начался новый депрессивный эпизод.

0	Ну тут все индивидуально конешн, само сочетание препаратов - весьма рабочее, в моем конкретном случае. Без врача я не стала бы химичить, уже пила прозак неудачно.

0	В депре и погулять-то не получится, такие спецэффекты ВСД, что закачаешься (в буквальном смысле). Я друга отводил к психотерапевту: рексетин, феназепам - да, нужно, не такие уж страшные побочки, как все боятся.

0	Хочется съесть все таблетки, что есть в пачке Рекситина. Но это чревато и глупо
0	Эфективность осельтамивира и занамивира fda признала как скромное. И разрешила заявлять по поводу ефективности только в лечении симптомов гриппа.
0	Разбирать все лекарства я не буду, потому что я с ними не знакома и надеюсь, что они мне не пригодятся. В сумке у меня всегда лежит Беродуал (сальбутамол) для снятия приступа и каждый месяц я покупаю турбухалер Симбикорт на 120 доз.

0	Ре бя та! Стали продавать какой-то новый флуоксетин. Задалась целью испробовать.
0	Потому что это Россия, детка. И любой действительно хороший АД здесь стоит столько, что проще купить говенный флуоксетин и забить на свои проблемы.
0	В Челябинске любую наркоту проще достать, чем флуоксетин ланнахер, имея на руках рецепт на него!
0	особенно если он под ксанаксом

0	У меня вопрос. Мне советовали метформин для похудения пить (а-ля как антидепрессанты, которые имеют в побочках анорексигенный эффект). Я же права, что у здорового человека при приеме метформина может случиться диабет?

0	Опять прочитала ужасную новость. Изымают Эреспал!!  Лечить астму и ХОБЛ теперь почти нечем. В глубинке нет ничего. Серетид раньше давали каждый месяц бесплатно. Теперь его нет в продаже. Астматики откликнитесь, как вы поддерживаете свое дыхание, чем снимаете приступы?Прошу ретвит
0	понятно. хороший недорогой антибиотик последнего поколения - азитромицин. хороший дорогой антибиотик - Таваник или цедекс.
1	СИОЗС вообще ни о чём имхо От прозака в дикую гипоманию уносило, плюс тревога пизда дрозда, ну и дереалы вплоть до галлюцинаций и потери памяти От пароксетина ушла тревога, но потом вернулась, депрессивную симптоматику особо и не убирал От флувоксамина я чуть не покончила с собой
0	Выпила одну таблетку флуоксетина ,ну че когда я стану анорексичкой ???
0	этого особо не был напряжен. Просто получал кайф* Однако, интересная реакция в эту минуту проходит в моем организме. То, что должно избавлять меня от тяги к наркотикам, сейчас борется с оксикодоном *хрипловато засмеялся, затем зарылся пальцами в мягкие волосы Алиссии*

0	а друзьям на этой стадии уже бесполезно звонить, да и зачем других мучить? если сейчас норм, то хорошо и хорошо, что без таблеток! я вот их пить боюсь, потом это надо с рецептом заморачиваться. а так можно верить в волшебную силу прозака и его не пить

0	мне нужны сигареты и возможно прозак  или флуокс что продадут но для начала нужны деньги
0	они только против симптомов. Чтобы завтра быть огурчиком надо противовирусный Тамифлю.
0	на прозак лет 20 уже как патент истек, по этому его кто угодно может производить, действующее вещество флуоксетин, средняя цена 150 рублей
0	форадил комби , очень хорошее средство
0	Немалый вклад в увеличение проблем с ростом хронических заболеваний и смертности внесло отсутствие с 2012 года препаратов с гормоном Т3 - Трийодтиронин. Всех щитовидных больных лечат только Т4 - тироксин,эутирокс, это приводит к тяжелым осложнениям!
1	UPD: Пульмикорт врач мне в ужасе отменила, поскольку "это же гормональное!!!" Как итог: мне снова хуже, но я уже не знаю, из-за отмены ли Пульмикорта, или нет. Улучшение было таким кратковременным, что как-будто и не было его вовсе. Начинаю хотеть умереть.
0	Лекарство: Отдам РЕАЛЬНО нуждающимся "прадакса" срок годности в норме. В коробке осталось 20 капсул.

0	Кстати мужик из рекламы сеалекса сыграл хорошо.
0	чисто теперь я закидываюсь флуоксетином суки довели меня
0	крепко подсел на ксанакс и феназепам, лечу хроническую бессонницу, а так с месяца 2 назад в дурке отлежал, все норм

0	Во мне три стакана молока сативы, сколько-то прегабалина сколько то гашиша, две рюмки кальвадоса и пол круга сибири. Не помню как ехал сюда
1	Весь последний месяц малодушно думаю, не нырнуть ли опять на кветиапин. После его отмены у меня полное чувство, что у меня выгуливать из черепной коробки все, что можно. Я хотела перестать его пить из-за гормонов и из-за того, что я не могла на нем сочинять тексты.
0	@888_cocaine На гидре разве есть аптека? Вообще я смотрела, но там только феназепам, ксанакс и только в больших количествах по почте или как то так🤷‍♀️ ну это в моем городе
0	Антидепрессанты с алкоголем, кстати, абсолютно непредсказуемо сочетаются. В основном всегда все норм было. Потом был велаксин, который в сочетании с алкоголем чудесно эээ чистил желудок. Сейчас, видимо, время трезвости - с двух бокалов я шальная императрица.
0	Нашла в старой сумке целую пачку флуоксетина. С 11.12.14 лежит, ого.

1	встала умыться, решила тип ща порисую. в голове шум, от прозака зевота сраная, перед глазами пятна. так и живем))
0	ещё с утра какая-то херня с дыхалкой. это стрёмно..ибо как-то преследует ощущение что моя астма проснулась..лет с 10 такого не было.. а если да,то привет "Вентолин"
0	Лето подходит к концу, на твоем конце только пару кредитов натянуто плотной резиной латекса, Паша давно не может спрыгнуть с ксанакса, а у тебя лето кончается, а у кого-то в больничной койке белой линией жизнь обрывается, цени то кажуал братка, что не имеет цены.
0	@Martisha5  У нас чаще всего Эгилок советуют, но он же по рецепту, а есть практически соседки-болтушки.
0	Флуоксетина и людиомил в горле уже стоит, не помогает
0	я купила всего лишь турбухалер и пшикалку в нос
0	А что сильней фенибута? Баклофен?
0	Не всегда мона лоперамид)при отравлениях низзя например)
1	Вышла на работу, давление сразу упало и начало тошнить от венлафаксина (или не от него). Сука ну спасибо.
0	@serbret981 Дорогой "славянин", от всей души желаю тебе никогда не узнать, что такое сальбутамол, а также астма, немозможность ДЫШАТЬ, корчи на полу БЕЗ ВОЗДУХА, когда кончился баллончик с сальбутамолом! Живи с миром. Это я тебе как спортсмен-любитель и астматик говорю.
0	Я без флуоксетина, как Эллиот без морфина.
0	это не эстетично и не прикольно — есть горстями прозак, флуоксетин или какие другие таблетки
0	Тамифлю , но судя по описанию при любом чихе им не стоит закидываться, отпускают только по рецепту
0	Из за ожидания результатов экзаменов сижу на таблетках И пока не на ксанаксе)))))
0	Повторение постмайданного времени. Держитесь, Юля уже готовится закупать Тамифлю и газ по 450.
0	твой псих точно дурак, он должен был тебе назначить схему слезания с паксила, даже мой это делает
0	БОЖЕ, ХРАНИ КВЕТИАПИН И ПСИХОТЕРАПИЮ
0	повезло еще и в том, что под прозаком можно в общем то продолжать пить, что, конечно, радует и не радует одновременно
0	Хорошо ,так :на кетилепте ,акинетоне ,велаксине . Хорошо три месяца без азалептинок ч аминазинкой.
0	Сейчас как плюну на завтрашние пары, обопьюсь кофейком, закинусь метопрололом и пойду смотреть стрим.

0	Напомните мне, с чего я вообще взяла, что это история про революцию?.. Два сезона прошло, а пока это была лишь история Феноменально Плохих Решений поразительно аморфных для дистопии людей. И тормозов, богиня, там все под Ксанаксом? Я все понимаю, саспенс туда-сюда, но бляяяять
0	Дают мне рецепт на цефалексин и просят дать ципрофлоксацин  Нормативные, вообще нет?

0	И это не под прозаком ,охуительно!
0	Все так зависит от фармацевта. Вот снова мне не поставили в рецепт, что выдали АД. Я спокойно могу пойти и купить в другом месте ещё три упаковки. И ламотриджина ещё.
0	Пресвятой джигурда, и кто ж этот препарат запретил?! Сибутрамин - это лекарство от ожирения. И, он никем не запрещён в рфии. Лично я его свободно покупаю в аптеке, правда в Раше он местного производства и имеет массу побочек.

0	@Doodlettae @mal_mars Если не работают антибиотики,нужно бы прижать метаболизм бактерии. 1. Klebsiella любит глюкозу =&gt; кето-диета + метформин для понижения глюкозы 2. Узкое место для любой бактерии - железо =&gt; хелаты железа для пациентов с ферритином &gt; 40. Вопрос: медики что-то такое используют?
0	А правда почему нет дженериков ? #Экселон
0	4 дня работала - 4 бутылки эссы по скидке. всё в порядке, просто очень хочется вспарыватель швейный в глаз воткнуть. лучше подбухну. а потом, глядишь, прозак заработает.
1	самое клевое испытание для отношений это абсолютное отсутствие желания ебаться при приеме флуоксетина. настолько клевое, что я, будучи опять на второй стадии ОКР, слышала от тогдашнего бойфренда "выбирай: секс со мной или твои таблетки")))))))))
0	А, не Просто у венлафаксина побочки ахуевшие
1	@faketelecastic флуоксетина знакомая жрала 80 мг развозило пиздец

0	ОРВ не лечится. Нужно перетерпеть мистические 7 дней. Другой вопрос снять симптомы недомогания. Здесь тьма эффективных препаратов от Ринзы до банального Парацетамола. Единственный препарат слегка затрудняющий оккупацию тушки вирусами - Тамифлю, но и он зависим от метаболизма
0	мне еще цифран и диазолин пить. классно, да? нет

0	эти вечные муки выбора, флуоксетин или лоперамид
0	однажды ты спросишь, что я люблю больше: город под подошвой или ксанакс. я отвечу -  слава кастеру трою и ты уйдешь на своей уёбской подошве так и не узнав, что эта гречка для вас, эта гречка для нас

0	Ципрофлоксацин тебе в помощь. Если это конечно бронхит.
0	Просто хочу напомнить,что эта дама в уродливом костюме имеет разрешение WADA на прием оксикодона, гидроморфона, преднизона, преднизолона и метилпреднизолона. Сложно даже представить, чем она больна. Для тех кто не знает - это системные стероиды, а не безобидный мельдоний.
0	Я тоже люблю ксанаксом закинуться
0	И форма, в которой прегабалин не выпускают.  Они с аптекаршей долго спорили.
0	Утром у меня в пальцах лопнула капсула флуоксетина. Пуфф - по темному дереву комода. И я равняла белое крошево в дороги и думала, а может, может?..  Могу.  Миледи спасает глупого грустного рыцаря.
0	Тамифлю эффективен в первый день. На третий уже бесполезно
1	я крч вкинулся флуоксетином,лег на кровать в ожидании прихода,ну знаете,апатия,залипание, но в итоге просто началась изжога и башка болит

0	@Ally_Besoalone @shevelev_on_air Сначала когда пил только арипризол, паксил и депакин, у меня было жесткое ощущение, не мог найти себе место, это сводило с ума. Особенно, если надо куда то ехать на такси или общественном транспорте. Чуть не ебнулся) когда добавили мендилекс и атаракс, то стало норм
0	Д ебать, может хватит? Флоурити, ограничения конечно никто ни кому не ставит, но если ты хочешь себя успокоить ксанаксом и алкоголем, то тебе будет минут 30 хорошо, а потом будешь блевать и будто молотком по голове ебнут, так что не лучшее сочетание
0	Кто пробовал ПРОЗАК? Какие впечатления?
0	В случае привыкания от сосудосуживающих кап.,для снятия отека и заложенности подойдут местные стероидные противовоспалительные, назонекс и Морис в рб без рецепта, не знаю, как у вас(активное вещество мометозон),насобек(беклометазон) и фликсоназе и назофан (флутиказон) по рецепту

0	@alisa_problems Я понимаю, что глупо об этом думать, но у меня сильные проблемы с восприятием себя   Я осведомлена о других побочках Но в другой раз мне вообще выписывали сероквель, что намного хуже и нейролептик У всех таких колес неприятные побочки
