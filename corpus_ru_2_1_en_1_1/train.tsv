0	imodium ad beckham. mitt romney listens to
0	harm reduction! cheaper alternative that allows users to return to normal functioning. subone costs even more.
1	"my effer has left me with the inability to cry. i was dry eyed watching ""into the wild"" and even one of those sarah mclachlan commercials"
1	oh well this might be why the side effects from cold turkey quitting pristiq were so horrible. it is concentrated effer.
1	i can't take this i thought having seroquel would make it easier but nope. my whole body feels like i have raw nerve endings going crazy
1	well,yesterday was rubbish(post humira)all day in bed,loads of pain etc.just got up and i think i'm alright?give it an hour and reassess lol
1	trazodone has screwed up my sleep schedule. its helping tho.
1	take a strattera they say. it's like adderall they say. and then i was trying to figure out why i felt like dying all day
0	if my ra gets any worse, i'm gonna be on bed rest until bcbs personally delivers my humira
0	a prozac a day makes the voices away
1	i felt drugged on ritalin. i love vyvanse. i can't tell i'm on it except for feeling better and calmer and more structured
0	Чтобы вы понимали количество 🤫🤭:  изъяли 200 грамм травы и 379 таблеток Ксанакса.
0	48. Ненавижу тех, кто вечно на позитиве. Как будто ксанаксом обдолбались
0	it's a good thing i have a shit ton of adderall or working hours back to back would kick my ass more than it is already.
1	eat my trazodone then go to bed, wake up in the morning with holes in my head
1	i take mg of lamictal everyday i'm tired leave me alone
1	Меня от таблетки Флуоксетина и глотка коньяка снесло.
0	aw no pls don't
1	lunesta is hours of miserable sleep and nothing like the fascinating well funded ad campaign.
1	Я, кстати дозировку до 200 у сероквеля снизила. С 450. Ну, пока вроде просто чуть более раскованно чувствую. И то может просто на хороший секс наложилось.
0	i guess silva didn't take his boniva this morning.
1	6 day rivaroxaban diary. just been to cut some wild roses down so workmen can easily get to part of my garage. intense back pain.
0	both are still profitable. invokana is a good drug. st in class.
0	Раз в месяц марафоню неделю растение запрещённое на территории РФ. После недели употребления начинается депрессия. Это состояние легко лечится прегабалином или баклофеном. Прегабалин желательно взять 300. Баклофен 50. И психоза как не бывало. Как вы там
0	never never never combine drugs acting on ras system i.e ace inh, arbs, aliskiren even if patient is diabetic.
0	haaaa depression hurts try cymbalta bitch!
0	let me have my morning coffee and prozac before you start your shit.
0	искренне надеюсь что он пошутил насчет ксанакса
1	Мониторьте своё состояние внимательно, Саша, что не так - сразу к врачу. Иногда АД меняют. (По себе знаю, от Венлафаксина эпично блевала, не смогла пить.)
0	so interesting!! any mention of meds like symlin, victoza and their impact on lag times, post meal hypers?
0	"""remember when cassie had to buy miralax because she couldn't shit?"""
1	Путешествие закончилось одновременно с паксилом 😑Надеюсь, я куплю новую пачку до того, как мозг осознает, что а) вокруг снова серо и холодно; б) нового захвата серотонина не произошло 🌚
1	Я сейчас пью паксил + кветиапин. Уже полгода. Мне отменили мощный транквилизатор и меня накрывает эмоциями, врач говорит что это нормально и надо перетерпеть
0	enbrel was my st biologic. then cimzia now orencia *fingers crossed*
0	i deal with the same issues. sometimes all i have is trazodone. working out and eating healthier has helped.
0	do you know what is badass ? ciprofloxacin that's what's badass
1	(дисклеймер? панчлайн? ю нейм ит) мне 23 и ~ последние 3 года я работаю над изживанием wounded child внутри себя (с переменным успехом) (последний год с помощью ламотриджина спасибо ему!!) потому что сичас-то всё не так и мы победили эту хуйню
0	Меня в тадже однажды гашишом угостил таджик-памирец,когда в больнице с дизентерией лежал,мол,заменяет лоперамид.Поспал часов 5 очень быстро и с цветными мультиками
1	i'm sorry you have ostrich halitosis but that is a side effect of once monthly boniva.
0	~~member post~~ my doctor is starting me on effer. do any of you have eerience with this med? how has it worked for you? thanks.
0	commercial for victoza says not to take victoza if you're allergic to victoza. apparently some complete morons have taken victoza.
0	rt : i wonder if mrs. kitchel actually took that paxil.. haha
0	oh great. mg of temazepam and i still can't sleep.
0	ну тогда еще и лоперамид не забудь выпить сегодня
0	“: i have codein at night :/” - doc didn't want me to take that so i have pregabalin which is helpful
1	короче, когда мне снизили дозу венлафаксина, мне через какое-то время стало полегче. два дня мне было сносно, я даже смогла съездить к полине, убраться в комнате и сделать ещё пару мелких дел. на этом всё, сейчас я опять лежу и от тахикардии в груди жжёт
1	did they just say the side effects for crestor was dark urine and yellowing eyes? who would want that?
1	yeaa bihh all jacked up on vyvanse!
1	thanks. there is a nonzero chance that the discomfort i am feeling was caused by going back on cymbalta, possibly too quickly.
1	synthroid completely kills my energy levels and armour thyroid makes my heart beat rapidly. think i'll just stay in bed all winter
0	wonder where my subone went that i just took.
0	yayyy katy hope it works ..you can have one of my humira stickers if you like. h and van stickers from healthcare at home
1	starting humira tomorrow. i wonder if it will make me tired for a day or so like remicade did. if it works, it's worth it.
0	tell him to get some uloric it works for me
