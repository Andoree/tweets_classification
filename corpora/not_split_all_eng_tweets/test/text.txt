happy to hear that dr. morphine!
i'd suggest a lactaid and a lipitor with it. and maybe widen the invite to include a cardiologist?
i had zero sleep on tuesday night and then last night was hours. i�ve just took some clonazepam and doubled the dose so it will force me to sleep. i�ll be too tired at the match tomorrow and won�t enjoy it otherwise!

these tablets make me feel more drunk than what alcohol does ?? morphine in tablet form ?? taking some of this pain away thank god
now watching: war games. i'm nerding out so much i'll need valium.
you are on xanax
a client who has just undergone surgery is receiving continuous intravenous (iv) morphine sulfate for pain control. on assessment of the client, what does the nurse check first?
i was once on a statin for "high cholesterol", it was crestor. it almost destroyed me! so much pain, stomach problems, i got so sick! got mad at my doctor and threw the pills at him and fired him told him he was trying to kill me! i began to learn the deadly dangers of that crap!
i woke up in the middle of the night to have water but i was so high on morphine that i fell asleep while i was drinking and i just woke up to wet clothes and an empty bottle in my hand. ??
welcome to the cult, sister. bring lipitor.
xanax and desyrel=mutlu bir hilal
surely, kosh. the dm issue serves more as a misleading speech for statin denialists. yesterday at a children's party, a relative of mine w/cad and very high cv risk features on max doses of crestor + repatha aked me exactly about it: he had heard it from another doctor ????
would he actually have to stop taking them if he supplements with coq10? my family member who became almost crippled stopped taking simvastatin abruptly and started coq10 and the pain was gone within a few days. now he takes rosuvastatin and coq10 and no problems.

i've been taking viagra for my sunburn. it doesn't cure it but it keeps the sheets off my legs at night.
haha you know how it be when i take my blood thinners and crestor
since roseanne is blaming her racism on drugs, what drug was she on when she called susan rice an ape back in ? oxycontin?
how is efficacy measured for crestor? lowered cholesterol? or fewer cardiovascular events?
it actually has but what dp you eect when all we have now are codeine sipping mumble rappers
i would like to thank adderall for making it possible for me to function on my least functional days

"this test compared cbd with both aspirin and tramadol. aspirin had a moderate effect on tissue swelling, while tramadol had little effect. the full spectrum cbd prevented swelling of the mice paw to a greater extent than either commercial drug"
bc drug co r soo honest about side effects.. lipitor=t2 diabetes..
on the other hand, we have these regulations because of *literal* snake oil. and thalidomide.
oh doesn�t it just. it�s been a really rough week if i�m honest, where i�ve been ill i haven�t been keeping my tablets down i�ve been having withdrawals on top. i�ve managed to not sweat off my morphine patch at least last night ?? x

listening to this month on mixing loperamide cimetidine to get more of a “methadone” effect makes me question why opioid addicts are so much better at chemistry than me.
if taking ambien causes racist thoughts as a side effect then taking adderall should cause random acts of kindness.

just saw a criminal act; a tv ad for the drug atorvastatin; generic for lipitor. that s**t is poison; it causes type diabetes; dissolves tendons for which there is no repair; causes other problems too; supposed to be for high cholersterol; which is a diet exercise issue. poison
i�m nauseous /7 and coming off that morphine isn�t making it better ??
sorry about the gas, i�m on crestor????

�codeine crazy� is still the most beautiful trap song to ever grace the land
for some reason that doesn't help much maybe cuz she used to take it for so long must have built a tolerance or something! have u tried lyrica?
no more metphormin and lipitor so no more pre-diabetes and my cholesterol is which is too low, so off lipitor all from fasting &amp; the keto diet

the metformin was partially my idea. trying to look for drugs that can help with beetus and possibly help with heart disease. instead of crestor. which would improve my slightly high (127) ldl at the cost of a lot of insulin resistance.

opiates should be used in lowest dosage- after first line of medications- naproxen is used to treat inflammation response unless in surgery when both is needed. any demand from opiates should be given subone and a clinic.

previously all cholesterol meds got approved based on cholesterol reduction which was surrogate marker. lipitor later proved with cvot benefit but zetia and simvastatin failed. that lipid reduction is not good enough marker anymore. espr has to show cvot outcome to get approved.
vicodin and oxycontin i heartily agree with you daniil as they�ve become the biggest drug problem in the usa. they are more euphoric than heroin, cause less desire to puke and are being pushed like dealers push smack. opiates should only be prescribed for short term use.

he wrote me bactrim and kelflex
i don't know anything about media ilk, but this past week for trump has been a nightmarish disaster, so much so that even was criticising him. and his tweets seem to be getting more frantic. someone needs to get him on prozac to help make him a bit less erratic.
i took adderall and i�m still hungry this is proof i�m fat
is gabapentin now a controlled substance? good grief.

i didn�t even sleep that badly compared with usual - and i remembered to get up and take some diazepam after the first half an hour or so of anxiety. yet i still feel a wreck. i was up an hour earlier than necessary due to - you guessed it, anxiety
adderall is a powerful drug.
you would be alarmed if you knew how many high school students are already popping xanax everyday. reason you aren't reading about the numbers is because it isn't killing anyone like opioids are. parents of teens need to get a handle on this, fast.
in the piece you talk about froome taking two puffs in the morning and two at night, that sounds like a normal prescription for a preventer such as symbicort (formoterol).
why did my mom bring me xanax lmfaoooooo
people ask how to lose weight in life, get into a relationship, get destroyed by it, get an adderall prescription, than boom
approximately one-third of fatal opioid overdoses could be averted with a scale-up of long duration opioid agonist therapy, such as buprenorphine and methadone.
can neurontin even be abused at all?! i haven’t heard of such a ridiculous thing.
i reeeaaaly want to do this but it�s am here. and i dance like a white uncle who just drank redbull with xanax.
that nigga on xanax prolly blacked out

oh my dear if you lived here in maine they will give you free methadone let you drive home and kill someone while driving,but if you're a good person want to take care of your health you're an asshole?!!

since i stopped smoking my tolerance so low my dr gave me some codeine pills for pain felt like i just smoked some blunts ????
wow thats crazy, before i got adalimumab (humira) injections i honestly was on verge of depression. since being on this treatement i feel x better. surely with history they should let you try it out to see if it helps. its been a life saver for me.
was taking lipitor and got pain in legs, etc. started taking heart health and feel great. great to take if you have high cholesterol and heart trouble.
took high dose of simvastatin for a few years but suffered with bad cramp in my feet. now on lower dose of atorvastatin with no side effects. know a lady who is the opposite. she can�t take atorvastatin, so keep a close eye on side effects and ask to change them if you need to.
my wife takes a large dose atorvastatin and has managed them fine since she had major heart surgery last year. no side effects to speak of. i take a smaller dose of it and am fine after struggling with synvastatin which made me feel really sick. hope that helps!
lots of people are poor and don't have insurance. have you ever had your insurance not go through and hear the price of your meds? i pay $10 for my adderall. one time the card fed up they asked me for $1500 with a straight face.
codeine dreaming - kodak black: praybe faithfultake care of your well be�.
wow i�ve been trying to get ativan or klonopin for years but no one will give it to me. and prozac stopped working for me. it�s all so frigging discouraging.
i was referring more to things like heroine, amphetamines, and other drugs like that. i do know that there at opioid problems and other addictions to pain medication that can be hard for some to stop taking
also i did mention i'm a bit dopey. valium, man. fucking love my doctor sometimes. back pain is grand when you can get a bit high.
promethazine n xanax took away my ability to show emotion
absolutely, i agree with you there. i just think you�re preaching the wrong message here in regards to peep. it�s not �keep doin xanax just take the right measures to make sure it isn�t laced!� that just ain�t it bro
my back is killing me from the crestor
i have had this exact problem in the last two months! i've been on tramadol and cocodamol for just over years, and it has pretty much worked for me this whole time. same amount and dose for years also. now dr is refusing to give me both and labelling me an addict.
rior to the development of a wide range of relatively low-toxic synthetic pesticides, some alkaloids, such as salts of nicotine and anabasine, were used as insecticides. their use was limited by their high toxicity to humans.[2

a rough night to say the least. i have a lot to do today so i am not doing the codeine prescribed. yesterday i slept most of the day. diet is to be soft but in-out is all i am thinking about.??
it�s obvious that is clearly out of puff at

second the withdrawal from prozac is horrendous. the next im riding this wave of emptiness. but, at least now the emptiness doesn't hurt.
morphine is on the firefly playlist times. another thing you might miss from noe valley.
my own dose of hypocrisy is i strongly encourage my patients to take their maintenance medications yet i can�t religiously take rosuvastatin. ??
still hoping his lipitor will fail and he’ll stroke out.
�~ i said "here's your lipitor." i didn't say "you're a whore." what's your friggin problem, lady?!

hi yeah can i get a uhhhh [reads menu] um do you have anything that's not liquid methamphetamine

this is probably going to sound like a stupid question, but is metformin a form of bc? i�m just wondering because i was diagnosed with pcos and that�s what they prescribed to me, but i�ve heard people say that it�s not a form of bc
i found some xanax in my bed, i took that shit, went back to sleep. they gon� miss me when i�m dead, i lay my head and rest in peace.
niggas really sip promethazine with no codeine. why
i appreciate your point but most t1 pwd are not on insulin rather on metformin. you are conflating costs and arguments. low carb diets are a wonderful solution but where the costs are a factor and pwd are on insulin lcd not be impactful. please do not conflate your arguments.

i hope you can find something that works for you. i went from prozac to zoloft and now lexapro. lexapro has been the nicest one.

as for the morphine comment, what about those like me who are allergic to the drug. i would damn sure hate to be your patient. i can't believe a doctor would vilify a person because of a prescribed medication. you gentlemen are the real problem
for just a moment i was transported to a better time (without xana.
mine is exactly like that. they're always threatening to put me on lipitor.

i feckin hate that show! it would scare the be-jaysus out of me! u�d need half a valium afterwards!
same seroquel
can you say atorvastatin? what pharmacy do you want it sent to?
gabapentin is rough and very addictive. my grandma is on it for nerve pain in feet and she has never been the same since she started taking. breaks my heart.
the problem is with the pharmacies who want to play doctors and refuse filling scripts for people with mental health issues. why can i buy a gun in min but to get my viibryd, xanax er and ativan it is hell? all due to my issues related to raising my daughter with cerebral palsy
i've got weed &amp; valium
prozac needs to be free.people don't care only if you are a celebrity you get some attention.
sorry, but if you’ve been out using meth for the last days, i doubt zyprexa, an antipsychotic, is gonna cure your addiction. why do doctors prescribe this crap for ppl who are addicts? addiction is not psychosis!!
shit i just switched to concerta from adderall
people who take for xanax for fun are so fucking stupid, &amp; they don't even know it.

sorry , it�s totally useless, and some wrong information shared , for ex darvin,
it's atorvastatin! drug used in heart ailments, raised bp for cholesterol maintenance. leading cause of death in the world is cardiovascular disease and nearly everyone after nowadays suffering from raised bp. no wonder it's the highest revenue generator.

morphine was good but wait for flowers and rope
she should have stuck to legal drugs like xanax and everclear
it looks like s young child did it. maybe she�s had to start drinking to handle the stress. maybe some xanax a little off her game. she looks like a demented evil clown.
all these codeine got me stopping
again. the piece we are commenting is from . pfizer�s patent for lipitor (atorvastatin) eired in . run the numbers of years of sales of a stating under patent and tell me it is not worth at least hundreds of $ millions.
subone is so popular with addicts it has turned into a street drug be bartered/exchanged for money, heroin/other illegal drugs. according to one estimate, about /2 of the buprenorphine obtained via legitimate prescriptions is either being diverted or used illicitly.
death doesn't care what brings it. you're just as dead when you intentionally jump from a tall bridge as you are when you take doses of phenobarbital, or when you sit in your garage with the engine running, or slit your wrists with a razorblade. take care of your own crap.
bruh i didn't sleep for like days after finals lmao adderall is wild
no, him scared. downing diet cokes and xanax at an unhealthy clip.

yeah i am. though valium is probably more ideal than klonopin. valium lasts longer but has a stronger sedating feeling compared to kpin. xanax has a stronger come on but yeah been prescribed mainly xanax or kpin throughout the years.

i made tea and put miralax in it lmao
stop offering me adderall
went down on my meds today. the third pill of effer was giving me high blood pressure, so i'm trying again where i originally felt fine. nothing like throwing up, diarrhea, dizziness, and all-around yucky feeling for a day or two. blech.
i suspect eired, cheap codeine that was seized from katsina is often shared at those crosscarpeting rallies
ive been on crestor since my early s. it's been relatively ok but i have been concerned if memory issues in the last few years is a long term side effect of statins.
i think how politicians think maybe their all on the new fashion called opioids. i heard methadone clinics aren�t bothered because it�s a business for most states there is your epidemic plus drugs methadone is a opioid and the clinic people sell to others that don�t no and od

question phd�s and md�s out there: if atorvastatin, simvastatin, and all these �statins� raise nitric oxide, can they also be used as anticoagulants? if that is so, can they contribute to hypotension when taken + other ace/betablockers?
i know not everyone agrees but i % think benzos and legal amphetamines are next.
xanax the panic, metal problems you can add it
everyone, thanks for coming to see little old me today!
i'm thinking more of its use in bipolar depression � quet and lurasidone are both indicated for that afaik but aripiprazole isn't.

i am always surprised that a man who appears to be constantly on valium is so outspoken against pill taking
i think xanax is too soft a drug. he needs to up it to a heavy dose of adderall or concerta to calm his hyperactivity. wonder what pharmacy he use.
lmfaooo listen i need a xanax
i understand. personally, i have gained lbs since oct. . i know you don't know me, but i am soooo not lying. i've pretty much lived on ice cream and cake. i'm on lipitor now. i just want to live long enough to see him out of office, however that happens.
im really happy that when people talk about beans now they are actually talking about beans stuffed into a random household object and not xanax
yes, i�ll be fine, but also yes, instead of sleeping once i finally got home from everything last night, i stared at my dad�s bottles of xanax literally until i had to start getting ready for work. my brain did not let me sleep a wink.
compare it to the ??that�s legal and the effects thereof. opioids, alcohol, methadone. and they worried about weed. please they just lookin a justification imprison black ppl.
has anyone else ever been on cymbalta and felt like complete utter shit after starting it?
ooo, this xanax too spicy
i need xanax watching jon.
do you take crestor or lipitor? also causes muscle wasting. i know. supplements sometimes help with the residual pain.
what about methadone used all over the country and controlled by the government. just as bad and addictive but the government makes money off it
morphine, lover make me numb
drug sex i might fuck her off a xanax
my dad swears by that stuff. says it helped him reduce his cholesterol when docs were trying to push the lipitor drugs. he's a rebel. hates drs lol
we use revatio (sildenafil oral solution mg/ml), where pah is its' stated use. otherwise in sweden the only paperwork would be to write "sic!" on the prescription, i've always thought of canada as more liberal and at the forefront.
lipitor is responsible for his death his cognitive issues, dementia, stomach aches were all side effects of the medication. my mom suffered the same an the muscle damage statins caused took her life. his lipitor was discontinued before his death - doctors know truth lipitor kills
he was prescribed lipitor after his heart surgery ! all his health issues were side effects of the drug. cognitive issues, uti, stomach pain, shuffling gate, muscle weakness/disease. it took my mom�s life just as it did robins -
bisoprolol, perindopril, atorvastatin

i did od on xanax, after a long night of drinking and adderall. mg is a lot. i don’t suggest it!
and they can ask about having a stimulator implanted in their spine, depending on the type of nerve damage. are they sit opposed to opioids or is addiction an issue? some ppl use methadone or subone under supervision, but i�m not sure they�re really better options
gonna play wow while the xanax kicks in. this air quality is making me super stuffed up and i keep waking up thinking i can't breathe. add to that the fact that i can smell the smoke just slightly and it reminds me of when we had to evacuate for fires. no bueno.

arewa girls are suffering sha. your men are literally sleeping inside codeine and inhaling all the soakaways but they'll have liver to come online and criticise you for makeup.una doh.
i love my quetiapine. the side effects are a drag sometimes, but it�s so nice being level % of the time and being able to trust myself!
/5 of course i can't speak specifically to your wife's situation but in general terms: prozac, as all ssri anti-depressants (&amp; probably more so, since it is the most activating) at times can increase irritability, anger and even paranoia. those are not acceptable side-effects
venlafaxine does on me but mania is no good
i just read an article that says sub is being abused at a higher rate than oxycontin was during it's prime. i'll try to find it.
finally saw . it was filled with asthma attack inducing laughter. thanks and
just in: introduces generic drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol in us
the doctor team gives me these prescriptions for drugs the small pills can put down a rhinoceros the big ones is for a octopusy hell i can get valium if i want this is for research and all the tests
i can't remember if i did when i was on citalopram, it was years ago, but i do get it with venlafaxine if i don't eat something either immediately before/after i take it. might be worth a shot? even if it's just a piece of toast or something. hope it settles down soon ️
weird, my dr wants to order an ecg if i stay on this increase of cymbalta. i�m assuming it�s because of my tachycardia which i�ve always had. also monitoring the myoclonic jerks.
take a xanax and u got this
ok so i took my meds, hunger busters, an appetite suppressant, zapain (codeine) and a couple valium.
lol. lipitor is cholesterol medication. ??
i�m pretty sure at this point my blood type is arb+ (adderall + red bull)
i just started a sentence to my roommate "well because the sun is in virgo and i'm capricorn rising i've really want been adderall" this is me. this is who i am now.
this is how you redescend the pitavastatin.
i have orientation today which means it�s a great day for my prozac to be giving me heartburn.
if you can use advanced search or pubmed, there is one biologic that is supposed to be more efficacious than others. i searched my history under biologics already--so look under humira. search bar example: "biologics from:fridawrites," replace the word biologic with another word.
i have another appointment about it next week. it's with an integrative medicine specialist, so hopefully they can offer something other than xanax. that crap scares the shit out of me.
this already happens with the flu vaccine nearly every year.
a kiss can be times more effective than morphine in reducing pain by triggering the body's natural painkillers.�
crack cocaine sir you�re smoking crack out of a pipe smh
atorvastatin beto. catchy.
the end of a very mixed day draws closer. going to try a morphine/tramadol cocktail in a bit. see if that numbs the physical and mental pains.
clonazepam
also, an aspirin before bed may help. if you try gaba or phenibut, those help give you a deep, restorative sleep. dhea also helps keeps stress hormones low if taken before bed. anything that improves liver function will help sleep becuase that is where glycogen is stored.
atorvastatin beto
ahh, secondary anxiety issues as well. might i suggest ativan or xanax +/- a touch of daily use seroquel? follow-up in weeks and let�s re-evaluate where you are.
well, i got about /2 hours sleep yesterday. and i haven't slept since. i. hate. codeine. i also hate that i will use it again after the month without is up. ??
just like nicotine, heroin, morphine. suddenly, i�m a fiend and you�re all i need.
neurotypicals abusing adderall has made it difficult for people who actually have adhd to gain access to it, but whatever hope you finish that final essay hours before class boo

i do not hang with people who do xanax
but somebody make this make sense how did i just get prescribed tylenol codeine for this migraine but your not suppose to smoke weed during pregnancy ? wouldn�t you think the opioids would be more harmful??
i used to abuse the fuck out of xanax when i didn’t have much anxiety, but now that my anxiety is through the roof the feeling i get is so smooth and doesn’t actually fuck me up. my bad thoughts actually shut the fuck up when i take them and i’m slowly starting to feel better.
i dont shoplift since im not a xanax addicted teenager but l o l
the resulting low nicotine consumption (obtained from vaping) could possibly and partially elain the relatively low quit-smoking rates. vape shops: do not limit nicotine strength.
i'm so glad to see you post this!!! may god bless you and be right on your shoulder as you put this behind you!!!! three members of my immediate family are recovering alcoholics - oxycodone is a different addiction - but i've also seen strong addictions overcome! crush it!
this article begins "opioids like morphine"- morphine is not an opioid. at the very least someone could use the correct terminology.
that's what xanax and alcohol does to people
�maybe she�s born with it. maybe it�s intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus.�
xanax at the disco????
?? society has gone mad! i posted a pic &amp; complimented cicely tyson's hat on ig &amp; the "deep saints" are coming for me saying it was a witch's hat. ?????? listen!! y'all need xanax!
do you know if any will be available at the school? i didn’t get the vaccine last year, then proceeded to miss a week due to flu. i’m getting vaccinated this year!
i've never watched anything that has made me so angry in my life. i think need beta blockers and valium to calm me down ????
i don't believe codeine cough syrup is not in the same realm as oxycontin. i have had both. the cough syrup w/oxy in it was amazing, and my doctor told me not to even bother asking for a refill. codeine cough syrup? i usually get a big bottle and a refill if i ask.
i tried it for my migraines. it was very relaxing (i fell asleep every time), but it didn�t change the number or severity of my migraines so i stopped. (fyi zonisamide did.)
but if we do that how will their kids get their methadone?
adderall and coffee is a horrible combo
yes! i had one that questione d my reaction to hydrocodone thought i was seeking morphine insisted it was all he would give. mins after taking it i had a severe reaction. my throat was swelling shut he never returned. i had a new dr. immediately"

diazepam
one day my son gonna see my pictures and ask what i was on and imma tell him four lokos and prozac
it�s so annoying, like a �growing pains� feeling. i don�t have a bath and can�t take codeine, looks like i�m stuck with it for now
-one flew over the cuckoos nest-requiem for a dream -prozac nation -truman show-steel magnolias
i will i will. this isn't even too bad, it's the morphine or whatever that's making me look so tired i promise.

the wounded beast lashes out but, in his age, he has grown weak and flabby. he knows he must keep his heart rate down as he does not wish to up his crestor prescription again.

i just took a lot of loperamide and had a cut off point that i wouldn't eat after. i did suffer incontinence with my jpouch for some time, and was given loperamide and codeine to take every night, which i still take now xx

melania, did you have to take valium before you spoke about this? it's the only way you could have kept a straight face.

morphine is crazy good. i've been sawn in half, conscious on morphine. twice. talked to the anaesthetist all the way through both times. didn't even care that i could smell my own burning flesh. crazy stuff.
okay who here in peoria has adderall?
yep, adderall definitely fits the bill
fuck i�m so thankful for my ativan
adderall is a real life senzu bean lol
my mother was in assisted living when i moved back to boise, and no one was allowed to visit if they were sick. i can't imagine passing the flu or a cold on to an elderly person, as those illnesses about kill me. i hope this year's vaccine is more effective!
it�s the morphine drip. other wise wise i would have called him a-hole.
yes. she thinks she passed it at the er when she was on morphine when we were getting our orders and scripts. it was like ungodly pain for like hours. from am when she woke up till pm-ish when we left. we were meeting daughter's boyfriend's parents by pm for homecoming.

fascinating. high amounts of magnesium and calcium. makes you wonder what the origins of these conditions are. brain needs cholesterol, lipitor recommended for management of cholesterol. no correlation?
that's what all those nootropics are basically. noopept is ok, as is phenylpiracetam they don't make you limitless but they are like baby adderall

some people just need to take a xanax or something. jeez
that is described how i feel when i see on screen and constantly scamming for people your stupid show ratings. also no one is gonna get over the fact you have a fmr survivor contestant take xanax and vodka in your green room that you set in there for ratings.
thank you so much. i remember you saying you suffer from the same as well, i�m so sorry. she�s actually messaging me right now because she can�t sleep/sleeps very little. she doesn�t want to go on heavy duty meds so she�s been living off of xanax, which isn�t good either.
can you link me the article mentioned at pm news on prozac (fluoxetine) interactions with antibiotics?

not trying to contradict the stupidity of juuls and vaping, but vapor isn�t always a bad thing. i was constantly taking nebulizer treatments as a kid so my albuterol (in the form of vapor) would reach my lungs quicker and be more effective, therefore allowing me to breathe better

i�m always terrified to fly- actually i�m part due to trauma reactions from my rape and feeling trapped and not in control on a plane. though i avoid it when possible- i fly sometimes. i needed xanax to get to and from my honeymoon. the only other time i used it was to testify.
human here. even xanax hasn't made this any more bearable. this bitch is beyond the lethal doses.
my head hurts! i just lost all respect for the good ole boys club! i hope somebody switches from their viagra for a larger dose of potassium, for each of them. grahm and grassley makes me sick
duh-one can suppress total panic attacks on planes. meds like xanax, wines etc. i was a severe white knuckle passenger and was barely able fly.

no matter how the fbi conducts the investigation i have to pray that a few days of reflection and breathing room will lead some senators to conclude he�s too much of a hothead for the job. with that said i�m popping a xanax.
who tryna run comp later? need some sweats with gunners and adderall, not trying to take any ls
why not do all the other stuff like increasing your vitamin d intake etc. but also take flu vaccine. remember, vaccines save lives.
keppra can be great for some and even seems to go well with the ketogenic diet. many can lower dose significantly to get off completely. google "mike dancer and epilepsy" i believe this one one of the aeds that caused him significant side effects.
i was the lead singer of children of thalidomide
ah. but the thing is, you wouldn't be on tramadol, if x paracetamol every hours and a hot water bottle sorted it :/ i still don't understand how entonox can take the edge off, when tramadol + codeine won't. does make me blather utter rubbish though.
hope no one looks into rampant laudanum abuse during ruth bader ginsburg's high school days.
lipitor
heading to next week? get your now. we don�t need an epidemic flu strain named after our convention. don�t think i�m serious? � ask an american legion member about their convention in philadelphia.
im like a completely different person off adderall it's crazy
that is a boat load of prozac! we could get some more from christine ford, it appears she has a lot of it?
tramadol. synthetic opiate. i once forgot to take night time dose and woke at am crawling round the bed, not a clue what was wrong until realised. i have no problems taking it but withdrawal is shit. i think it's very easy to become addicted like you did.
it's only way the heart that we see fully. - methadone mick
i saw a new script for vascepa come across the day after this broke, must have been coincidence, it was over $100 and she didn�t take it. the atorvastatin dose was increased and still free.
okay awesome. i take klonopin right now to help me sleep
when i was on effer, if i took it more than hours apart i had pulsing headaches. it wasn't a sustainable schedule for me

ooh ooh that's cruel!!! can't keep my eyes open at mo as had codeine but do tell tomorrow!
i don�t take clonazepam every day in an abusive recreational manner you intrusive clingy bitch -mgmt
these are the types that drink cyanide-laced koolaid or eat applesauce ala phenobarbital. they will follow the leader whether it is the idiot or some other opportunist.
i�ll take the tramadol
also going cold turkey to get clean has extremely high rates of relapse. getting clean with the help of medication like subone has a higher rate of success and lowers death rates. if you've never been an addict of any kind, you should probably not give your two cents.
what is apixaban job?
same thing, except they use lipitor and aspirin instead of weed and psychedelics. also they have six-figure incomes.
my insurance reapproved my remicade infusions and i�m so happy i could cry ??
olanzapine for headache? also, droperidol is very cheap
and the opioid they are most showing neonatal syndrome to is subone, buprenorphine &amp; methadone!!! tax funded opioid drugs for addicts, to continue their opioid addictions life, and not from pain patients / ( considering % of pain patients have been forced tapered/removed
i just found loose prozac in my backpack lmfao

i suffered badly last year with it. mri revealed nerve root compression. epidural didn�t work. went private and had root block injections which made a big difference. the worst thing was coming off the strong medication, pregabalin, dreadful stuff. ok with paracetamol now.
started the prozac today, the zyprexa last week. takes about a month or two for them to revv up. atypical depression blows.
it would seem that the reason people turn to the dark web, instead of buying from their local pharmacy, is important. is it medicine prices? no awareness that xanax=alprazolam?

anyone else tried to get off venlafaxine(effer)? i�m wanting off it asap and if the psychiatrist won�t take me off it i�ll stop it myself
lithium sucks n that fuckin shit is not helping me ?? even prozac. holyfuck kill me.

luckily he found out about obama care. my parents were still using their insurance and when the doctors saw that the carac and lipitor prescriptions began.
as long as the indicator was actually written on the script it always complied with pfizer’s demands. did mean that if neuropathic pain was the indicator then pharmacist had to issue lyrica (and hb pay for lyrica) but meant as soon as nd patent eired could revert to generic
diazepam is more lipophilic so quicker onset and half life of its metabolite is over hours. knock yourself out all weekend.

hi, i�ve got awful emetophobia. i took trimethoprim when i had a uti. i got very anxious about it but it�s best to take it to avoid a kidney infection. and i later read on the nhs website that trimethoprim rarely has side affects such as the one you�re worried about.

trying to quit xanax and cigs is hard man but i think by the end of the year i got it
so we were enjoying a sweet sugar cane with my friends and one of them said it can be used as an anaesthetic and the other said it can be used to cure diabetes, i wonder if there's insulin,metformin, or even halothane in sugar cane.
yup. i'm allergic to most of them but if i ever have to go to falwells house of dumb then get me a benadryl and a morphine pump. or probably propofol.
then we get into the ones that can leave you permanently disabled or not able to function at all if you cannot access them. lyrica, topirimate (used as a migraine prophylactic), anti-depressants . . .
i see you�ve gone far enough in your medical school training to be brainwashed by the dogma of that field. i suppose all the individuals who have healed using cannabis don�t count? i used to be on humira. psoriatic arthritis. nothing but cannabis for meds now and life is better.
a/ garry i don't disagree w preventing msyn. in clinical practice behavior rx not usually sustainable over to years. a pill a day (niacin or lipitor) can be taken no matter what the stresses of life bring to a person. under stress, it is difficult to maintain discipline

does anyone have an adderall or a gun
hello. you have advice on how to get off of klonopin?
seriously, in the last half hour i've struggled between an extra xanax, or large quantities of wine?
does anyone have morphine
also odd was when the ldl hypothesis gets dismissed while extolling "pleiotropic" benefits of statins, but then later on you criticize trying to study these benefits as "rosuvastatin trying to carve out market share" ?????love the show but ya goofed on this one imo.
the entantiomer of modafinil. more potent. people generally perfer if looking for laser focus.
�you know dinner means xanax and a cigarette�
this is me at the moment, nearly out of options, more to try. i never thought i would be this bad, was pain free for yrs on remicade then it all went pear-shaped. recent failures over past mths - xeljanz, orencia and now actemra.

we'll be moving. we have cats (and a chinchilla and an anole). so we'll be renting a minivan and driving them up, we think. today i am testing the youngest's reaction to gabapentin.
oh wow, i'd not encountered mirtazapine before, but doing a quick skim on its method of action it sounds like it would solidly solve any insomnia. i'm on a tiny dose of olanzapine at night. i sleep *incredibly* well on it, but can be quite groggy in the morning.
the parents are ill-informed about flu shots and now many children are hospitalized because they don't receive the vaccine.
the age of risperidone is up for i am called i saw the judas' who sit blind and in control of 'civilisation'these people too are human and their children our in pain i had a vision of their children cutting their wrists. it was more than a dream. in the name of life|god
note to self: pop an ativan before making stressful adult phone calls, not after
you look young. have you studied up on what smallpox &amp; polio did to our world? or even the flu? have you actually *read* about how many died before the measles vaccine was developed? or how many were hospitalized? how many developed complications? encephalitis?

� i pop my pussy like some adderall �
so, france just started prescribing subone on the reg? the article is wrong though: subone is a very powerful opiate, itself &amp; it is absolutely addicting.
i hope you got a side of lipitor
when i spoke about the pain aishling eerienced while dying, needing to be dosed up on morphine etc prolife individuals said �discomfort� was par for the course yet here they are screaming about pain in the womb.
xanax needed
no. vascepa didn't show interference with crestor. refer amr-102 phase pk results.
he studied tramadol
can�t wait for trumps next pick. all you pussy liberals are going to keep therapists in business . get those xanax ready !!
got me off subone and then the kratom was easy to get off of. now that i'm opiate and kratom free i was able to get a good paying job that drug tests.
muscle memory has almost gotten me several times. most recently this week. i give a ton of solumedrol. less protonix. but they’re right next to each other. went to pull protonix. instinctively pulled solumedrol. they look nothing alike. luckily i realized it seconds later.
simvastatins really the only statin patients bother to take with meals. lipitor isnt as fat soluble and rosuva prava etc are water soluble so i doubt mineral oil had a large effect. $amrn had a spa anyway so youre beating a dead horse.
man after in day shit be hurtin ?????????? cole off that adderall /7 but just naturally
i taste codeine when i burp
people who take adderall every day, do you have weird food cravings and aversions? lately i've found myself constantly hungry but most foods repulse me. the food aversion isn't new but being hungry all the time is. i just want to eat the same three things all day every day.
well, yes and no. they definitely won't stop the murders, as it doesn't solve the main issue. it'd be like prescribing morphine for brain cancer. it may get rid of some of the head aches it causes, but there will be others it doesn't get rid of and you didn't solve the issue.
???????? now i know where those truck load of tramadol were being moved to. obviously, to, wadata plaza.
: remind patients this december: black cohosh can interact with / and other drugs.
anxiety buspiron and klonopin

i once wanted a day off, went to the dr, last minute so had to see a new doctor, did my usual back is playing up restricted movement, instead of the simple day off i spent the next week in bed, doped up on valium and used up all my sick leave ?????
with is among the best things ever. perhaps only second to taking the of the century.
i am currently drunk on wine and prozac outside and lonely in a way. my babies are as untouchable as god.
klonopin i'm already on zoloph which keeps my anxiety in check most of the time as long as nothing comes up. if real anxiety hits i tend to lose my shit these days.
my ob let me take nexium! i don�t really like ice cream or milk so i tried to live off tums but they didn�t cut it
no one wants to spend their holiday season with the flu. that�s why for the national flu vaccine week, you should make sure to get your flu vaccine for your health and those around you.
to look your best, it�s important to feel your best. and no one feels their best when they have the flu. for this national flu vaccine week, make sure you get vaccinated so that you can continue to feel beautiful inside and out.
that looks more like icu psychosis. get that man some trazadone mg stat and daytime orientation protalocol. remove the alerts!
�casler then claimed that trump is a �speed freak,� and that trump �crushes up his adderall and he sniffs it because he can�t read, so he gets really nervous when he has to read the cue cards.�
she ignored his questions and boomeranged from one subject to the next like a racquetball. shamed him and the network. bizzarre comments. talked over him. i was thinking adderall. impossible to watch. learned nothing. annoying. we pay her to do this job?
tell me about it. still got statins and amlodipine, hopefully that'll do in the meantime.
he got pushed away for bragging about popping adderall and talking gibberish while constantly interrupting actual esports pros who were casting with him. there are tons of extremely talented ex pros who deserve a shot more than him.
do you just look in the mirror, see what you do and the damage it causes, and then just tweet it�s all the fault of the media or whoever pissed you off today? are you mega-delusional, or snorting adderall? either would elain the voices in your head and all that sniffing.

that's because he snorts adderall all day. he's a speed freak.
maybe trump just needs to share his adderall
how many crushed up adderall have you snorted this am? you seem particularly worried this morning.
adderall and xanax make such beautiful babies

for some, there�s a period (usually a day or two) of an �off feeling.� sometimes you�ll get a mild headache for an afternoon, as your body clears out�this is due to the loss of retained water. just drink more water and take some tylenol and it�ll pass quickly.
same here. opioids and tylenol are it

whoever is feeding his adderall �habit.�
as for the winging it part -- truthfully, he's been winging everything for well over two years, and a guy who snorts adderall isn't making very good decisions even before he's tweaking. he seems like he has stimulant psychosis."
he spelled harassment right! you know rudy tweeted that for him. that's their new made up term. fishing eedition doesn't work because it is more akin to shooting fish in a barrel. poor me! poor me! pour me some crushed adderall!

adderall calmed me down this morning from the nightmares i have.

fox gaslighting? faux news? gimme a break grandpa. don't you have some adderall to hoover up? get to work, get off of the toilet and stop your insane tweeting.
sure if it was bipolarity or adhd but since adderall didnt make me speedy its adhd? honestly not being able to afford help and having people constantly deny your shit is so hard. like i have virtually no memory now. my processing has vastly slowed in the past years. and tbh-
honestly it�s most likely my genes but i heard a copius use of adderall and coffee also plays a big factor ??
in bed crying because i�m realizing my life is in ruins right now &amp; i really really need my adderall. the part that makes me so upset is because i fucked up time, the st time they enforced the drug testing that drug test could prevent me from getting it again forever
that is weird about your doc and phenergan. i have both zofran and phenergan. the latter knocks me out, so i prefer to use zofran. but this is why we need . reactions to medications are so idiosyncratic. i don�t respond to any triptans, for example.

my dads favorite line : "take a couple tylenol, you'll be alright!" i had a sore throat ad could barely talk once and he said it was nothing. we eventually went to the er a week later, it was strep throat. the real kicker? he was military, we had great free health insurance.

i asked my psych to prescribe me adderall after an adhd assessment suggested it would help me. she didn't want to do it, just continuing to treat me for depression and anxiety. i've been working with cbt, but it doesn't work if my brain won't let me do it. i want the meds.

vyvanse is basically adderall with a protein added so it is not active until an enzyme takes that protein away. this happens in the small intestines. this makes vyvanse less available to abuse than adderall. vyvanse is not stronger.

some of these are justified, some are not, some are due to lack of prescribers using common sense (nexium, crestor, why in the world are people prescribing those as brand name?!). unless this is a very old slide? 🤔
ur the tylenol i take when my head hurts
rebota &lt; adderall
chills that stared a couple hours after end of chemo. hot beverages and hot soup helped warm her back up. i also dealt with her spiked fever that started up with her chills, two extra strength tylenol helped get it under control again. she dealt with nausea, doctor prescribed

dunno about the metoprolol. thyroxine enhances catecholamine action/permissiveness so i would imagine you need something not very cardioselective. they mainly need so see an endocrinologist but the methimazole is a nice bonus. i do think it would help to record any eye signs.
i get kidney pain every time. i'll take anything but tylenol.

freddy, i'm just an american like you. opioids are essentially heroin. and nobody anybody actually needs heroin. the "pain management" industry smells criminal. hospitals give out the equivalent like tylenol3 because nurses aren't told not to. if you have a headache take advil.

laura plummer got almost tramadol tablets 'from a friend' then took them to a country where they are illegal. tramadol is a class c prescription only medicine and it is illegal in the uk to pass it on to anyone else. so who is the so called 'friend'?
she takes mg focalin xr but it doesn't last all day. anything else is too much. and there isn't much else she can take due to her other health issues and medication.
this otter needs proventil hfa!
but xanax is not sweet
i agree. if it wasn�t for his website i wouldn�t have known lipitor causes myopathy. my father had it and was taking lipitor. i then looked at the insert for the medicine and there it was. the doctor didn�t even mention it when he prescribed it nor would acknowledge it.
a colleague of mine was on crestor...she looked in the mirror one morning before coming to work and she was the color of big bird...minus the feathers...
why is it absurd? tramadol is egypt�s number one recreational drug? selling pills would have been months wages for an egyptian
though a classmate took way too much codeine for her cough once and i had to deal with our bio teacher giving us awkward glances since she was zoned the fuck out the teacher never made any kinda big deal out of it though
it's funny when ppl try to justify xanax prescriptions i think of like cavemen having unbearable anxiety limiting them from leaving the cave and hunting sabertooths and just having to die in there without any drugs to help them cope with caveman life
is xanax supposed to make u super sleepy to get rid of ur anxiety bc it worked ??
i stopped taking atorvastatin because it made me very depressed. my cholesterol was already low. i presume it ended up too low.
why does donald trump take xanax for hispanic attacks ??????
congratulations to you. went to seminars, acupuncture, patches and everything out there. that horrible drug, celebrex. almost lost my mind with the sides effects. my friend told me about vaping and i do love it. might continue w/only ejuices.

hope you get well soon, i have been sick for a week in bed with feaver and pneumonia , and now my back pain is preventing me to sit, stand or walk, even rotating in bed is impossible, getting morphine few times a day to get up for tolet runs. was at the hospital for days.

the fact that people still do xanax is hilarious
angina lol am a gimp, na but seriously anycunt got tramadol
i'm on fucking chantex hahah
tramadol combined with adderall can cause serotonin syndrome tho. since they both release serotonin. i�ve only heard of adderall treating adhd and hypersomnia.
why lyrica is even on the controlled substance list is beyond me. same goes for vimpat and potiga

gawd, i sure hope trump's on a hefty dose of lipitor!
that�s easy. don�t go to work, stay in bed, take lots of sick days. be miserable. it�s worth it given how enormous the codeine problem in society has become. especially compared to other social problems like mental illness, ice abuse and the strained health care system.
yeah, although when i switched from zoloft to effer recently, the sex drive came back uhhh way too strong. i'd rather have none than too much, tbh.

i fuckin hate xanax.
prozac made me sweat and itch like a bitch. i feel your pain. i had to stop it cuz i couldn't deal with it anymore.
this chronic pain thing is making me vague as heck. i havent had any codeine today but i'm still dithery and unfocussed. maybe lack of sleep. self-medicating with cheesecake.
yeah they stopped allowing refills when they moved norco over to a cii. my mom had to see pain mgt and that�s pretty much how it�s been since none of the drs will prescribe anything now but motrin and ultram. but filling it is the biggest issue now. she�s had the worst time.

gen�ricos de marca ?? quiz�s querr� decir bioequivalentes de otras marcas. aunque no son todos y tienen igual el sello , por ejemplo lipitor (atorvastatina) es el original y existen de otras marcas e incluso el gen�rico tiene el sello , no siendo exactamente igual.

damn, i have terrible time with statins and my cholesterol is high. i get major leg cramps. lipitor was the worst. thought i'd found something better in pravastatin, but it just took longer to cause side effects. have bad back, so took while realize the leg pain was the statin.
when you go to the v.a., your options are limited to metformin, metformin extended release or straight up insulin. they also dose me with repaglanide and glipizide. that's prettty much their offerings. i'm given atorvastatin now. wow, leg pain. do they give u antinflamitories

can�t believe how uneducated people are about this (lowri turner!) flu jab takes weeks to build antibodies&amp;you can�t get the flu from it! it is about % effective against flu, so yes there is a risk of getting flu after the jab but you won�t get flu because of the vaccine!
my nigga thats adderall. its literally amphetamine. i used to take that shit all the time ( i dont have adhd ) and it would make me hyper focused for hours. only problem was the intense mood swings, no sleep, ans no hunger

f*cking lipitor!

hey the family guy character crestor never asks for your gender, it just asks you to choose between four body types is family guy woke
then he doesn�t need antibiotics for his orange skin, propecia for his baldness issue, crestor for his high cholesterol and cialis so he he can continue his sexual assaults?
can i ask you a couple of personal questions? what meds do they have you on and do they mess with your blood sugar? since going on lipitor i am suddenly diabetic.
xanax ion do the molly ??
yeah, i didn't know celebrex has antiviral effects. could be very helpful for the prostaglandins my mast cells are flooding me with too, if i can ever increase my salicylate tolerance that is

how many of those with the flu got the vaccine?? including your �buddy� . if they worked, the vaccinated wouldn�t be getting the flu. you can�t blame this one on anyone. the flu sucks and so does that vaccine you�re so fond of. this vaccine doesn�t work.
i'm gonna take a snowed-in xanax nap now. play nice! ??
grade science teaches children that you help protect people from the flu through herd immunity. meaning that if % of people got the vaccine it would also ensure those people who can’t (immunity comprised) would also be protected. provide correct information not fear!
prescription: valium, ritalin and xanax.
the goddamn pharmacy and psychiatrist people won't work together to get me more ativan. screams
obese, elevated cholesterol despite crestor . but in excellent health. you don’t hear from many doctors .
medications that president trump takes daily, according to dr. ronny jackson: crestor aspirin propecia, to prevent male pattern hair loss a multivitamin"
according to the president’s physical, a diet of fried chicken, crestor propecia is the secret to excellent health
no shit! my dr put me on the lowest available dose of crestor &amp; started having me cut them in half months later because we "overshot the mark" &amp; got too low.
i missed the ambien one. i heard pseudo ephedrine for allergy symptoms and crestor for cholesterol.
the crowd size at his rosuvastatin calcium refill pickup tho"
i believe the dr. stated that is on crestor. i stopped after days because of at least muscle weakness amongst other side effects. apparently difficult to recover from problems if one is susceptible....
crestor has side effects, as does ambien, that could bring about danger (more) for americans. is another �leader� available to helm our country while he�s in ambien fog? there�s so much more wrong than �dr.� jackson claims.
he's on a low dose of crestor. he also eats a diet incredibly high in fat and carbs. he's also almost completely sedentary and elderly. that low dose of a statin shouldn't account for his cholesterol labs.
yes it happens. given my specialty i rarely see it, but yes sometimes people can live like garbage and reach nor can someone who is nearly obese, &amp; currently takes rosuvastatin calcium be considered ""excellent health"""
good plug for &amp; tho i guess
he�s taking a low dose of rosuvastatin. par for the course in a year old. wouldn�t even shock me if obama took a statin, he does/did smoke after all.
trump is on crestor &amp; has a cholesterol of ? i'm not a dr, but true story. i had a cholesterol of &amp; put on crestor (w/weight loss). within months i was at &amp; in months, i was at . according to today's report, trump's from last yr to now.???????
you�re right but a mind paired with poor physical health and profile of like can result problems per statement
don’t take all of the xanax at once. it causes you to string many words together in an incoherent manner.
what do you mean, ?these days i�d put the blame on the sackler family for lying about oxycontin.
he's also taking crestor, which would stabilize his bp. he even cheats on his health!
morphine and scopolamine was how we used to do it way back when.
i think he is wearing a male girdle! i mean look at him on his golf weekends, big ass, big belly. then he returns to dc for his hr a day job in a suit and his stomach is smooth. the man is a pig and if he doesn't have a problem why is he taking crestor?
his waist circumference plays a big part in his health carrying the weight. he�s taking crestor for his cholesterol levels; that�s a sign right there his health isn�t �excellent�.
that's after all the blood pressure medication and lipitor he takes to un-congeal his arteries of big macs
i pointed out yesterday, as did doctor, trump is on crestor, his statin drug. it's known to cause memory loss.
my father died of a crestor overdose at age . the cardiologist loved the numbers, but didn’t bother to look at his patient, who contracted rhabdomyolysis. pop was also addicted to ambien: hallucinations, nightmares. no propecia, though. so is layering that on, too
both are correct. dr. gupta is correct that his heart calcium score indicates arterial plaque buildup and the score is increasing. dr. jackson is correct that increase in crestor dose along with diet/exercise is about all that can be done. his ldl target should be &lt;75, imo.
trump = crestor masimo
i'd bet he has a very fatty liver with those lipid panel numbers. he's fooling no one. plus cholesterol plaques in his arteries. crestor and other cholesterol lowering drugs do not prevent a first heart attack. there is hope.
i know people who've been on crestor for years. lots of people inherit the tendency to high amounts of bad cholesterol. the doctor referred to panels in several discussions where he stated that there was not enough of an increase to suggest more testing were necessary.
i don't know what your dr will say of this but my mother in law could not take crestor cuz of muscle ache side effect so she tried flaeed oil but doubled the dose and it worked! (she's allergic to seafood so she could not use fish oil) it might be worth a try.
skip the lipitor. just send $20 to the church of the sacred bleeding heart of jesus . . . and they'll say a prayer for you.
is borderline high cholesterol. if he wasn't worried he wouldn't be on rosuvastatin (crestor) and daily acetylsalicylic acid.
look it up or just make an appointment with a general practitioner &amp; ask if those cholesterol figures with abdominal obesity (we can all see he's fat around middle) &amp; already on crestor, whether u should be worried.
no one is discussing that he is high risk, should have been on high intensity statin (20-40 mg crestor) per guidelines and didn�t even need ldl tested.
it�s not about fat shaming, it�s about lying. it�s about saying an obese yo on crestor is in excellent health. you think thousands of his minions aren�t ready for mcd &amp; kfc all day everyday?
and that�s after he took the valium.
crestor is a heavy duty statin. i can't take it. i take pravastatin, which lowered by ldl to under . if trump's ldl cholesterol is still , yeah that's bad. what is trump's hdl b/c is that's low he's really in bad shape.
hillary had pneumonia .. what a stupid doctor .. i wouldn't take my rabbit to see this chubby "doctor". trump is lb away from being clinically obese .. his ldl is above despite him taking crestor.
all this codeine got me nodding off, yo bitch at the crib nodding off.
sorry, but the wh physician initially failed to mention that �s has increased arterial calcium deposits, as well as hypercholesterolemia (ldl=143) despite taking crestor.
about : when my husband took it, it made him cranky and completely changed his personality. i couldn�t live with him on that awful stuff, when he went to a different med it brought him back to being himself. do not give trump more!
i can�t deal guys i have to go to the rheumatologist tomorrow i need to go to bed i need some fuckin ativan
//apologies if i pass out. took a hydrocodone to help with some pain and theyre great at knockin my ass into dreamland
crestor: high cholesterol, aspirin: heart, antibiotics: rosacea, propecia: baldness, ambien: sleep. but trump is in great shape
this weird orange creature,is an old man with the average health level of a person in his age,nothing more,nothing less,of course are problems,cholesterol plaque,increasing rapidly,crestor is not enough ( give him psk9 inhibitors ) for sure high blood pressure,migrains,etc
sending a physician makes sense if you want relevant questions. trump is being treated with an increase in his statin, crestor. but believe that a sedentary -year-old with very high cholesterol and borderline obesity is the very picture of health.
i read your column in the new york times. thank you!!! thank you!!! please continue to make this case publically, especially for "subone" which treats anxiety and other underlying causes of the self-medication of addicts
why are you making shit up again? mexico isn�t the most dangerous county in the world, the united states is bc a racist hemorrhoid is president. are you also building a wall to prevent oxycodone from being overprescribed?
i don’t think exercise and extra crestor is going to fix that. (
chicken flavored xanax
the "hydrocodone" you claim is an opioid was actually tylenol and not an opioid at all. i personally contacted the reporter about this and have the emails to confirm. the coroner confirmed it was tylenol that was found in his system.
hopefully his dr will prescirbe him crest toothpaste instead of crestor so his heart will elode
what are you a retard? just because he’s on crestor does mean shit, his real doctor said he was in excellent health
hey, i was just listening to that doctor read off your med list. you might want to look into the number needed to treat (nnt) for crestor since you're so smart. look at the incidence of side effects too. more people suffer side effects than are effectively treated.

since dr. jackson is going to double your crestor, please ask him about taking coq10 to help replace the coq10 reduced by crestor. the body produces coq10, but statin drugs reduce the level.

oscillococcinum and sambuccol are effective and % safer than tamiflu
dominique is slower than a snail on xanax
it�s not there fault! it�s a self medicating world of popu-lostness: the stamford, connecticut-based purdue pharma made at least $35 billion in revenue from sales of the painkiller oxycontin, which represents less than % of the opioid market share. it�s not my concern. lol
alcohol to be only available on prescription. kills far more than codeine.
i'm pretty sure that cheesecake, xanax or duct tape can fix just about any problem.
xanax!
when�s the next crestor announcement thingy?
or get a klonopin addiction

"wherein he immediately goes "wow, yeah, i can't help you there, why did you get sent here?", then saying he'll write a letter to the general psych management who sent me on the wild goose chase had to wait a few more months for appt i wanted, finally got quetiapine in summer"
guess what meds i was put on before prescribed opioids? yes, bextra, vioxx, and celebrex. we are guinea pigs! it's okay all the damage and side effects from these other meds, and off label uses, as long as it's not non-toxic to organs opioids.
if you are taking a statin (lipitor, crestor...) go get a potassium supplement that will help and ask your doc about clonidine (an old bp med) helped my midnight crazy legs a lot!

clarissa: nikki's earpiece is out, jack's half deaf, a horse and a girl have been shot, and at this point not even a extra strength xanax is going to save this day from getting any worse.
check out porkbutt's tl. i think it is the down low twitter account for lipitor. ????
adderall.
my brothers neulasta was also denied when he was battling stomach cancer
when does crestor or lipitor sign on as a sponsor of the fair???
how is it that xanax hypes me up to the point i can't sleep all night ??
did they deny ompro or neulasta? i had to go back to the hospital every couple of days to get the neulasta shots
rec'd neulasta for wks for chemo-induced neutropenia. i still ended up in hospital, nearly died. then the hospital said ins co denied coverage for the neulasta they already gave me. rec'd huge bill. fought it. still don't know who paid bill or if hosp forgave it. i'm so sorry.

the mg of lisinopril worked better !i didn't need that changed again !then a mg separated hydrochlorothiazide i do not appreciate !the metformin is suppose to be or not mg, because the lesser dosage desolves faster and works better the soft aspirin i need !

usually it makes me cry when it hits but i think that�s because i�m finally letting the stress go. it takes a long time to kick in though. therapist wanted to try xanax but that didn�t do much for me.
thats the hydrocodone hitting
time to snort xanax.
dr boxie has a valid point. ventolin inhaler is curative while seretide is preventive. a daily shot of seretide keeps asthmatic attacks at bay, but if you have an attack go for ventolin you do not need a power medication when your lungs are clogged.

i was told i would have to live with back pain for the rest of my life. they tried to put me on vioxx, which was causing heart attack�s and was pulled from the market shortly after. my back is fine now from other therapies
altered mind states, that is; lorazepam helped me regulate sleep, i kept busy through the day so tired by night; took up swimming again, fitness, lost weight, got fitter, improved diet; i never said to folk what i was thinking, in terms of insects etc; it would have sounded mad!
i think i need zofran more than my pt does.
adderall got me feeling like dis .__________.

i got my hands on some gabapentin idk what they do but ima take em
i was also on lipitor for about months along with metformin. my a1c came back at and lipids were "ideal". i think that the statin was causing cognitive issues. i am off both meds. my energy levels are coming back. (just anecdotal).
the lithium or the lipitor?
you need to be saluting tamiflu and go to bed.
i've done it accidently and was in constant anguish. i can't imagine doing it on purpose. i'd have to take a valium. ??
"morphine is a painkiller jane"
gabapentin may cause paradoxical cns excitation, however, this doesn�t make sense based on the known physiologic mechanisms of action (although it�s not fully understood). loperamide certainly does cause fatal dysrhythmias, which i would argue are worse than theoretical seizures
i have been on statins since my early twenties as i have fh. i have refused to go on stronger and stronger drugs save going onto to crestor when i was . within weeks it affected my memory. i went shopping at my local mall and coudln't remember where i had parked my car.

crestor was the only statin i could take that didn't cause me to have muscle atrophy. my insurance denied me at first, then my doctor insisted, and the co-pay is a month for pills. it'd be without insurance.

i�ve been watching old home movies lately &amp; it�s really got me thinking. my mom on her wedding day was not the woman months before she died &amp; definitely not the woman i knew. xanax &amp; other opioids are not a trend. don�t let them ruin your life &amp; the lives of the ones you love.
if you�re trying to guess my prescription, try again. there is more than just paroxetine on the market. just because you read something about one drug that is in a similar category as others, doesn�t mean it applies to all.
have also had some success with zydis (olanzapine odt). similar effect without need for iv access.
my attempt was with pills (ativan/ambien), good scotch, and a nice lager. i was stunned when i woke up. the irony is my front door opened across the bay from the exact middle of the golden gate bridge. i survive each horrible day to day in az now - and that's no accident.

interestingly grandpa taken off atorvastatin today, i have been banging on about this for ages
never had. but in my s, they gave me morphine for about hours trying to figure out my severe pain. turns out, i was hemorrhaging so i got the full "stat" eerience being rushed into surgery but the dope made me way to calm at their panic.
i had to read this three times and then doublecheck your bio before finally being able to read "liquor" instead of "lipitor".
just get a ten year supply of xanax fren lol
i can�t believe some of you rely on adderall for energy and focus *slugs addictive teeth-staining caffeinated beverage*

true, morphine only masks the pain and when it wore off its like, oh crap, that was a mistake. it's easier to just ride it out than to dr it and be a big baby
well one easy test is if the improvement goes away quickly when you stop the drug. but still might have slowed decline. but, yes, very hard to answer. is metformin disease modifying? i'm not sure anyone knows after all these years.
bullshit. this stuff started in the late '80s when they started drugging young men wholesale w/ amphetamines (ritalin), anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds. i remember how it was before.
they put my grandpa on statins at . he couldn't figure out things in his head quickly and had an incredible memory. in months he was showing signs of dementia, and died at . his father died at . i'm convinced lipitor took him from us too soon.
diamorphine alone is not "poison". long-term effects can be negative, but many rx's can cause issues. crestor can cause rhabdomyolysis long-term insulin use can lead to hypoglycemia, weight gain and an increased risk for cancer. it becomes more poisonous b/c of its illegality
does your dad take generic lipitor? i almost became an invalid. pain lower back. aching leg. couldn�t get up from a couch. quit taking it. now i�m running up steps in my house again! (7th decade as ul fan &amp; life)

good luck - lair can be extremely beneficial for many patients!
i'm feeling a lot better, thanks. it was touch and go for a while. tamiflu and antibiotics were required

u take care. it was totally obvious last night by the encore that u has given ur all. take ur tamiflu. if that is what the doctor gave u. this flu is no joke. many people ending up with pneumonia on top of it. so take care. and thanks for pushing trough last night.

placebo can produce side-effects, desired effects and withdrawal! withdrawal from ssris is easy to manage. can�t see what all the fuss is about. venlafaxine is the exception because of the very short half life. but even then, easy in the hands of a good pharmacologist. p
