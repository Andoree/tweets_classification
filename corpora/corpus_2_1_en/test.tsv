0	tramadol. synthetic opiate. i once forgot to take night time dose and woke at am crawling round the bed, not a clue what was wrong until realised. i have no problems taking it but withdrawal is shit. i think it's very easy to become addicted like you did.
0	it's only way the heart that we see fully. - methadone mick

0	i�ll take the tramadol
0	also going cold turkey to get clean has extremely high rates of relapse. getting clean with the help of medication like subone has a higher rate of success and lowers death rates. if you've never been an addict of any kind, you should probably not give your two cents.
0	what is apixaban job?
0	same thing, except they use lipitor and aspirin instead of weed and psychedelics. also they have six-figure incomes.

0	started the prozac today, the zyprexa last week. takes about a month or two for them to revv up. atypical depression blows.
0	it would seem that the reason people turn to the dark web, instead of buying from their local pharmacy, is important. is it medicine prices? no awareness that xanax=alprazolam?

0	are you aware of the definition of racist. pop a prozac and fuck off to your safe space snowflake
0	i knew that's what they'd do. the hospital ed shouldn't be doling out the narcotic prescriptions so readily. ibuprophen is an anti-inflammatory &amp; pain reliever. codeine is useless in helping your finger heal.they are helping to fuel and maintain the opioid crisis in the usa.??

0	he�s taking a low dose of rosuvastatin. par for the course in a year old. wouldn�t even shock me if obama took a statin, he does/did smoke after all.
0	trump is on crestor &amp; has a cholesterol of ? i'm not a dr, but true story. i had a cholesterol of &amp; put on crestor (w/weight loss). within months i was at &amp; in months, i was at . according to today's report, trump's from last yr to now.???????
0	you�re right but a mind paired with poor physical health and profile of like can result problems per statement
0	don’t take all of the xanax at once. it causes you to string many words together in an incoherent manner.
0	what do you mean, ?these days i�d put the blame on the sackler family for lying about oxycontin.
0	he's also taking crestor, which would stabilize his bp. he even cheats on his health!
0	morphine and scopolamine was how we used to do it way back when.
0	i think he is wearing a male girdle! i mean look at him on his golf weekends, big ass, big belly. then he returns to dc for his hr a day job in a suit and his stomach is smooth. the man is a pig and if he doesn't have a problem why is he taking crestor?
0	his waist circumference plays a big part in his health carrying the weight. he�s taking crestor for his cholesterol levels; that�s a sign right there his health isn�t �excellent�.
0	that's after all the blood pressure medication and lipitor he takes to un-congeal his arteries of big macs
0	i pointed out yesterday, as did doctor, trump is on crestor, his statin drug. it's known to cause memory loss.
0	my father died of a crestor overdose at age . the cardiologist loved the numbers, but didn’t bother to look at his patient, who contracted rhabdomyolysis. pop was also addicted to ambien: hallucinations, nightmares. no propecia, though. so is layering that on, too
0	both are correct. dr. gupta is correct that his heart calcium score indicates arterial plaque buildup and the score is increasing. dr. jackson is correct that increase in crestor dose along with diet/exercise is about all that can be done. his ldl target should be &lt;75, imo.
0	trump = crestor masimo
0	i'd bet he has a very fatty liver with those lipid panel numbers. he's fooling no one. plus cholesterol plaques in his arteries. crestor and other cholesterol lowering drugs do not prevent a first heart attack. there is hope.
0	i know people who've been on crestor for years. lots of people inherit the tendency to high amounts of bad cholesterol. the doctor referred to panels in several discussions where he stated that there was not enough of an increase to suggest more testing were necessary.
0	i don't know what your dr will say of this but my mother in law could not take crestor cuz of muscle ache side effect so she tried flaeed oil but doubled the dose and it worked! (she's allergic to seafood so she could not use fish oil) it might be worth a try.
0	skip the lipitor. just send $20 to the church of the sacred bleeding heart of jesus . . . and they'll say a prayer for you.
0	is borderline high cholesterol. if he wasn't worried he wouldn't be on rosuvastatin (crestor) and daily acetylsalicylic acid.
0	look it up or just make an appointment with a general practitioner &amp; ask if those cholesterol figures with abdominal obesity (we can all see he's fat around middle) &amp; already on crestor, whether u should be worried.
0	no one is discussing that he is high risk, should have been on high intensity statin (20-40 mg crestor) per guidelines and didn�t even need ldl tested.
0	it�s not about fat shaming, it�s about lying. it�s about saying an obese yo on crestor is in excellent health. you think thousands of his minions aren�t ready for mcd &amp; kfc all day everyday?
0	and that�s after he took the valium.
0	crestor is a heavy duty statin. i can't take it. i take pravastatin, which lowered by ldl to under . if trump's ldl cholesterol is still , yeah that's bad. what is trump's hdl b/c is that's low he's really in bad shape.
0	"hillary had pneumonia .. what a stupid doctor .. i wouldn't take my rabbit to see this chubby ""doctor"". trump is lb away from being clinically obese .. his ldl is above despite him taking crestor."
0	all this codeine got me nodding off, yo bitch at the crib nodding off.
0	sorry, but the wh physician initially failed to mention that �s has increased arterial calcium deposits, as well as hypercholesterolemia (ldl=143) despite taking crestor.
0	about : when my husband took it, it made him cranky and completely changed his personality. i couldn�t live with him on that awful stuff, when he went to a different med it brought him back to being himself. do not give trump more!
0	i can�t deal guys i have to go to the rheumatologist tomorrow i need to go to bed i need some fuckin ativan
0	//apologies if i pass out. took a hydrocodone to help with some pain and theyre great at knockin my ass into dreamland
0	crestor: high cholesterol, aspirin: heart, antibiotics: rosacea, propecia: baldness, ambien: sleep. but trump is in great shape
0	this weird orange creature,is an old man with the average health level of a person in his age,nothing more,nothing less,of course are problems,cholesterol plaque,increasing rapidly,crestor is not enough ( give him psk9 inhibitors ) for sure high blood pressure,migrains,etc
0	sending a physician makes sense if you want relevant questions. trump is being treated with an increase in his statin, crestor. but believe that a sedentary -year-old with very high cholesterol and borderline obesity is the very picture of health.
0	"i read your column in the new york times. thank you!!! thank you!!! please continue to make this case publically, especially for ""subone"" which treats anxiety and other underlying causes of the self-medication of addicts"
0	why are you making shit up again? mexico isn�t the most dangerous county in the world, the united states is bc a racist hemorrhoid is president. are you also building a wall to prevent oxycodone from being overprescribed?
0	i don’t think exercise and extra crestor is going to fix that. (
0	chicken flavored xanax
0	"the ""hydrocodone"" you claim is an opioid was actually tylenol and not an opioid at all. i personally contacted the reporter about this and have the emails to confirm. the coroner confirmed it was tylenol that was found in his system."
0	hopefully his dr will prescirbe him crest toothpaste instead of crestor so his heart will elode
0	what are you a retard? just because he’s on crestor does mean shit, his real doctor said he was in excellent health
0	hey, i was just listening to that doctor read off your med list. you might want to look into the number needed to treat (nnt) for crestor since you're so smart. look at the incidence of side effects too. more people suffer side effects than are effectively treated.
