0	i hated trazodone. i felt like i took nothing. have u tried lunesta? i guess so since u said everything. i'd didn't like lunesta
1	consider nuvaring or orthomicronor (the mini pill) bc they both cause less weight gain!
1	is mtx called methotrexate ? if so i was on that pill but it didn't help. she wants me on humira or enbrel etc. but not now

0	miralax tastes like glue
1	i was just diagnosed months ago and im on birthcontrol and was on metformin but it made me too sick so i quit cold turkey

0	that bad that both ‘profen &amp; paracetamol aren’t lowering his fever. if it gets worse, then back in for diclofenac or paracetamol injection.
0	the toxic and poisoning oxycodone pills she takes aren't helping her pain. so there ya go! is natural.
